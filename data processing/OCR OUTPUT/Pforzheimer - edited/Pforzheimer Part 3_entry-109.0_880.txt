                  In this edition eight of the Sonnets included in Thorpe’s 1609 edition are omitted; all 
                  are regrouped in a new and  apparently arbitrary order under fanciful headings with 
                  the pronouns altered to suggest that the sonnets, written to a man, were addressed to 
                  a woman.  This volume  also includes the full contents of the Passionate Pilgrim 1612; 
                  A Lover's Complaint;  the Replies (by Raleigh and Ignoto  to Marlowe’s lines) from 
                  England’s Helicon 1600; the Song from Measure for Measure IV, i (in the longer version 
                  found in Beaumont   and  Fletcher’s Bloody Brother 1639); The Phoenix  and Turtle; 
                  Orlando’s verses from 4s  You  Like It III, ii; and Elegies by Milton, Basse and an 
                  anonymous  writer. 
                    Sig L2 is headed  ‘An Addition  of some  Excellent Poems, to those precedent, of 
                  Renowned   Shakespeare, By other Gentlemen.’. These include poems by, or elsewhere 
                  ascribed to Jonson, Beaumont, Heywood,  Carew, Herrick, Strode, Richard Clarke, and 
                 one  ‘I.G.’. 
                    Apparently the omission of the two narrative poems, Venus and Adonis and Lucrece, 
                  had some influence on the sale, or else a very large edition was published, for as late 
                  as 1656 this book appears in Moseley’s catalogue. Copies are still quite common, we 
                  have traced some fifty-odd, ten are in the Folger Library, but most copies are in poor 
                  condition although three or four are known in contemporary sheep. 
                    The sheets were corrected while passing through the press and copies consequently 
                  occur with minor variations (Trans. III, 1923, pp-252-3). 

                       tin some copies a facsimile, apparently from copper, occurs, It may be distinguished by several very minute 
                         differences, e.g. in the shading below the oval the copy has two unbroken  parallel lines; in: the genuine 
                         plate the top line is broken and a short piece between fills the gap.
