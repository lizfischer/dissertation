                               Tuis  is now accepted as a reported text of the original Shakespearean III Henry VI 
                               (see The Whole Contention). That the text of this play is, if anything, superior to that of 
                               The  First Part of the Contention 1594, may have been due to the fact that the reporter 
                               had  seen it performed more recently than the other. 
                                 Only  one copy of the first edition, 1595, of this play is known: the Pegge-Chalmers 
                               in the Bodleian. But of the present, nine other copies can be located, all but one in 
                               public collections, viz. British Museum (Steevens), Bodleian (Malone), Boston Public 
                               (Halliwell-Barton), Folger (Howe; Halliwell), Harvard (Kemble-Devonshire-Hunting- 
                               ton-White), Huntington  (Bridgewater; Locker-Church),  and Verulam  (imperfect).
