                                 First EDITION. Octavo. Black Letter. 
                                 Cottation:  At; B-M8;  92 leaves. 

                                   Contents:  title, recto [A]; dedication to Sir  recto B; text, English on rectos, Latin (in ro- 
                                   William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, verso[A]-    man) on versos, verso B-recto [M8]; colophon, 
                                  verso [Aq]; The  Argument,  and The  speakers,   verso [M8]. 

                                  Removed   from binding, bands intact. 534 x 354 inches. In half green morocco slip-case. Some- 
                                  what bescribbled; name  of George Diconson  (sixteenth century) on title. The Britwell (1924, 
                                  Lot 694) copy. 
                                  This may  have been at one time bound before Heywood’s  Thyestes and Troas in this collection. 
                                  In any event, it appears to have been previously bound with at least one other book. It is possible 
                                  that this is the copy listed in Thorpe’s 1851 catalogue. 

                               Tue  fidelity of this translation as well as the fact that the Latin original appears on 
                               the opposite pages would  make  this extraordinarily useful as a ‘crib’. 
                                  There appear  to be only seven other copies of this edition. Of these two are in the 
                                British Museum  (Garrick and  George III), one each in the Bodleian, Cambridge  Uni- 
                               versity, and Huntington  (imperfect) Libraries, while two copies (one imperfect) were 
                               sold at Sotheby’s in 1926. 

                                       +This  was apparently  used as a device by Sutton  for it appears also at the end of his edition of Castalio 
                                          Dialogi sacri 1560.
