                             Tue  author, on account of the low state of his reputation, attempted to bring out this 
                             play anonymously   but “the secret ‘happened to take air’ and he fell back upon pro- 
                             ducing it in the long vacation”. It is said, however, to have some merit. 
                                Since this play was produced in August 1711, the present was probably issued in that 

                               or the following year.
