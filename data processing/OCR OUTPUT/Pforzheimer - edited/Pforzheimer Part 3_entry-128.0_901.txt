‘Turs text is believed to be a reported one in which much of the verse has been para- 
                            phrased  as prose. In any case, it is a very bad text though the only one known. G.B. 
                             Churchill has enumerated many  parallels of incident and phrasing not given by the 
                             chronicles, often very slight, between this chronicle play and Shakespeare’s Richard 
                             III. Chambers,  however, observes  that though  the present may   antedate Shake- 
                             speare’s the reporter may have incorporated in his text reminiscences of the latter. 
                               Fleay has attempted to divide the scenes between Lodge and Peel and suggests that 
                             they were rewriting an earlier text of Kyd. 
                               The present copy, which is a fine one, was used for the Malone Society Reprint in 
                             1929. Only two others are known, the Folger (Halliwell- Warwick) and the imperfect 
                            Huntington  (Strettle-Rhodes-Dent-Devonshire).
