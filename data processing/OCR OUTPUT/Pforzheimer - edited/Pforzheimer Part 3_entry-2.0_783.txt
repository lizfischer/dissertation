Blue morocco, richly tooled, gilt edges, by Lewis. 734 x 534 inches. The Stanley (bought 1805. 
                           sold 1813, Lot 669) — Sykes (III, 1824, Lot 134) — Heber (VI, 1835, Lot 2761) — Britwellf (1920, 
                           Lot 133)— Clawson (II, 1926, Lot 620) copy with MS. notes of all the above and Clawson book- 

                                     plate. 

                            ‘Tue ellipsis which occurs after fol. 145 (Sig Or) marks the division of the copy between 
                            two printing shops. At Denham’s, the preliminary mattert and  sheets 3A-4M  were 
                            set-up; at Kingston’s, sheets A-20 were produced. The paper is the same throughout 
                            so, presumably, it was furnished by the publishers. 
                              Though  this ‘Tome’ in unpressed condition would make a volume  more  than two 
                            inches thick it is recommended in the preface ‘in steade of a merie cdpanié to shorten 
                            the tedious toyle of wearie wayes’. 
                              The importance of this book as the medium through which much that was character- 
                            istic of Italian Renaissance culture was introduced to English readers can hardly be 
                            exaggerated{}. Miss Scott has traced forty-three Elizabethan plays whose plots are 
                            to be found in the hundred and one tales included in the final early editions of both 
                            volumes. Among  the forty-three plays are five of Shakespeare’s. Equally important, 
                            also, was the stimulus which it gave to Greene and  Forde and  the other  English 
                            ‘novelists’. 
                              The present copy has been called the ‘finest copy known’ and no doubt it is, for the 
                            only comparable one, the British Museum (Nassau-Heber (VIII, Lot 1829)-Grenville) 
                            copy which is also very fine and clean, cannot match it in size. It is not a rare book in 
                            point of numbers, its bulk has prevented that, but there are few books which are more 
                            difficult to find complete and in good condition. The copies located are in the British 
                            Museum   (mentioned above), Bodleian (Malone), Huntington  (Heber  VI, Lot  2762- 
                            Ashburnham-Hoe),  Folger, Lord Aldenham  (title in facsimile), Bemis (Sotheby’s 27 
                            June  1927), Wilmerding (Seth Terry,  imperfect), Harmsworth    (Hodgson’s  1928, 
                            imperfect), Rosenbach (Dalrymple-Locker-White),  and  the  Sotheby  1901-Borden- 
                            Wallace-Levy copy now at the Rosenbach  Company.

                            no dimensions were given.

                                     another, found in English printing. In 1566, sets were in the hands of Gabriel Cawood (the original blocks) 
                                     and Richard Jugge (two crude sets, one signed, the other not) besides the set here used by Denham.

                                     are taken directly from the Italian and sixteen from Belleforest’s rather free French rendering.
