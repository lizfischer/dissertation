‘Tus work is written in a vein far removed from the scurrilous badinage usually 
associated with the productions of Nashe’s pen. This change of heart may, as Dr. 
McKerrow suggests, have been occasioned by personal misfortunes or loss of health 
but, in any case, appears to have been sincere even extending to the offer of an apology 
to Gabriel Harvey in the address To the Reader. 
In this volume Nashe compares the circumstances which brought about the siege 
and destruction of Jerusalem with the life of London at that time and prophecies a 
similar fate for London if her course is unchecked. The first part deals with Jerusalem 
and is taken from Joseph Ben Gorion’s History of the latter times of the Jews’ common- 
weal of which numerous editions of Morvyn’s translation were published in the six- 
teenth century; the latter part (fol. 38 to end) deals with London. 
The sincerity or at least the vigor of Nashe’s ‘exposure’ of the greed of the mercan- 
tile class and the malfeasance of public officers seems to have brought him into serious 
trouble with the authorities. Such denunciations were common enough in books of the 
period so that ‘either we must suppose that some recent scandal had given to the 
passage a special point, and even perhaps a personal application or that those in 
authority had already some ill will against Nashe and were more than usually quick 
to find cause of offence’. 
Therefore, when the unsold sheets were reissued in 1594, it was deemed advisable 
or necessary to cancel Sig X3tt which contained the objectionable passages and to 
substitute a leaf in which while much the same accusations were made they are more 
vague and the author disclaims any special knowledge of the offenders§. At the same 
time, Nashe availed himself of the opportunity to revoke his proffered apology to 
Harvey and open again the quarrel with him for, it was probably after the publication 

tWhen sold in the Heber sale it was in original vellum. A portion of the old wrapper is inserted with W.H. 
Miller's notes. 

4 The state of Sig X3 may be recognized by the variant readings given in McKerrow Nashe Il, 158-9. The 

cancellans is without foliation or catchword on recto; and the headline is in smaller type than elsewhere 
in the book, 

$e is of interest to note that the second edition, 1613, was printed from a copy of the first issue, 1593 and 
therefore has the original passages of X3 (there Yi).

of the present issue of this book that Harvey's New Letter [gor] appeared, though 
perhaps without Harvey's knowledge and against his wishes, ‘The alteration woe 
effected by discarding the first sheet and substituting two new ones (signed + and 
v4; the first leaf of being a blank, the last of, the cancel for X3) containing atte. 
page dated 1594, the same dedication as before, but reset, a new address To the Reader 
without the appended errata. These new sheets were probably printed by Richard 
Field, at least his device appears on the title and Roberts’s name is omitted from the 
imprint. 
The British Museum, Bodleian and Huntington Libraries have copies of both issues 
but no others can be traced.
