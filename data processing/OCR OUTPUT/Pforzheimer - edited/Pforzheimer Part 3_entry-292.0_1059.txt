                            Tue  authorship  of this ‘domestic tragedy’ has  never been  satisfactorily assigned 
                            although a number  of candidates, including Lyly, Lodge, Kyd  and  Yarington,  have 
                            been suggested. Neither has the question of whether Shakespeare had a hand in revis- 
                            ing it for the stage been settled.
