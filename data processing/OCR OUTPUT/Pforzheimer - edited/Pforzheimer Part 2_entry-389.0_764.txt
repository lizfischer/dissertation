Ture are slight variations} between the two copies in the British Museum and a 
comparison indicates that the present has the same readings as McKerrow’s ‘b’, the 
corrected variant.

This attempt to ‘wring juice out of a flint’ as Nashe calls the book in his dedication, 
though perhaps not so regarded by the reading public of that day as only one edition 
was published in Nashe’s lifetime, may now be fairly said to be the cleverest and most 
typically boisterous of all his works. During his exile from London Nashe took refuge 
at Yarmouth and must there have been hospitably received for the present book was 
written in order to repay the debt. It recounts the origin and development of that 
town with much flourish though yet with some regard for antiquarian accuracy and 
eulogizes the herring fisheries which have made it important in a burlesque encomia.
