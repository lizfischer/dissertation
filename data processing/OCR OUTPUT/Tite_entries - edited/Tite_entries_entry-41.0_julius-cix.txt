   Items 7, 8, 11 and 12 in the contents-table on fol. 1 are no 
     longer  in the manuscript   and there  has been  some 
     muddling   of folios: e.g. artt. 19 and 20 are a continua- 
     tion of art. 14. 
   Fol. 132v, art. 27, is headed â€˜Ex libro Croyland. foll. Mr 
     Lambart,    perhaps    indicating  that   (presumably 
     William)  Lambarde   was the owner  of a Crowland reg- 
     ister, though none is known  to have belonged to him.
