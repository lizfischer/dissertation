* NERO    DVIII  Chronicles. 
         Catalogues: 6018, no. 194 (artt. 1-13); 36789, fols 8-8v; 
           36682. 
         Fol. 3, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus’; fol. 176, art. 9, “Robertus ? 
           Cotton / 1588 / 18”. 
         Previous ownership: (of fols 1-175, artt. 1-8) ? John Stow 
           (signature: fol. 3), ? Walter Cope (Watson, ‘Cope’, 288). 
           E.M.C. van Houts, ‘Camden,  Cotton and the chronicles 
           of the Norman Conquest  of England’, in Wright, Cotton 
           as Collector, p. 240, believes that William Camden 
           owned  fols 72-159v, artt. 3 and 4 (and therefore fols 
           3-175, artt. 1-8, which form one unit), which he printed 
           (together with Vit. A-VIII, fols 5-100, art. 3) in Anglica, 
           Hibernica, Normannica,  Cambrica,  a veteribus scripta 
           (Frankfort, 1602). Her reason for his ownership is that 
           in the subtitle to the edition he stated that he was using 
           manuscripts from  his own library. Although this is not 
           impossible, the theory is in potential conflict with the 
           probable ownership  by Stow and Cope. 
         Previous  ownership:  (of fols 176-187v, artt. 9-12) ? 
           “Thomas  Pagit’ (fol. 176). 
         Previous ownership:  (of fols 188-344, art. 13) Robert 
          Glover  (if this is item J1 in the list of his books in BL, 
           Lansdowne   MS  58, fol. 105v). 
         Loan:  John Selden, 1638  (155.3: this, Jul. B.XIII, Tib. 
           B.XIII, C.IH, Vit. C.X, E.V, VIL, Dom. I, V, Cleo. D.V or 
           Faust. C.IV). 
         Fols 63-71, art. 2 of this, or Vesp. B.XXV, may be  the 
           manuscript  of ‘Nennius with a Comment’   that Jaspar 
           Gryffyth asked  to borrow  from  Cotton in 1613: Jul. 
           C.III, fol. 182v. Richard James’s contents-table (fol. 1) 
          assigns art.  2 to Gildas but the margin of fol. 63 is 
           annotated   ‘Nennius’, s.xvi%/s.xvii™. The ‘Comment’ 
           may   refer to a page of notes, also s.xvi™/s.xvii™, on 
           fol. 2v. These notes relate to art. 1 rather than art. 2, 
           but  both articles form a single unit. There are also 
            marginal annotations both in art. 2 and elsewhere in 
           the volume. 
         Simonds   D’Ewes  asked to borrow either (1) this manu-

script, Jul. E.VIII or Otho D.I, or (2) Cleo. D.IV, 1626 
    (82.24). See also entry for Otho C.XVI.
