VITELLIUS      E.XVIII Psalter. 
  Catalogues: 35213, fol. 43v (two entries: this, Tib. C.VI or 
    Vesp. A.1); 36682 (fol. 177). 
  Previous ownership:  Robert Bowyer,  11 June, 1590 (Jul. 
     C.Il, fol. 68v; Ker, Catalogue of Anglo-Saxon MSS, no. 
     224 b and c); William Lambarde  (49.35: (2) this or (1) 
    Tib. C.VI, and  see below);  ? John  Dee  (Roberts & 
    Watson,  Dee, M133). 
  Loans:  Patrick Young c.1616 (49.35, 134.26: (2) this or 
    (1) Tib. C.VI, and see below); ? James Ussher (this is 
    probably one of the psalters in the Gallican version that 
    Ussher  borrowed  in 1625: Jul. C.III, fol. 383. For his 
    collation, see Bodl., MS Add. A.91 (SC 27719), fol. 111.). 
  As this manuscript was in Bowyer’s hands in 1590 and as 
    Lambarde   died in 1601, it is much more likely that the 
    psalter owned by the latter (49.35) was Tib. C.VI rather 
    than  this manuscript, in which  case the manuscript 
    borrowed  by Young  will also have been Tib. C.VI. On 
    grounds  of size, moreover, Tib. fits the loan to Young 
    better than Vit. and was the manuscript  preferred by 
    Ker in his identification of that loan: Ker, Catalogue of 
    Anglo-Saazon MSS,  p. lv. 
  William  Lisle’s request in 1622 (Jul. C.III, fol. 239) to 
    examine  a psalter owned by Cotton may refer to either 
    this manuscript  or Tib.  C.VI, although there is no 
    evidence that he used either of them: Graham, ‘L'Isle’s 
    letters to Cotton’, pp. 365-66.
