OTHO    B.III* Scotichronicon. 
     Catalogues: no entries. 
     Planta catalogued this manuscript as B.III in place of the 
       manuscript  damaged  in the fire of 1731. When the lat- 
       ter was  restored, Plantaâ€™s B.III was recatalogued as 
        B.III*. Otho B.III* was apparently unknown to Smith 
       but as it, too, has been fire-damaged it was presumably 
        in the Cotton library by 1731.
