               Papers in this volume may be among  those sent to Cotton

               Loan: Bulstrode Whitelocke, 1652 (231.25, 26: (2) this, or 
                 (1) Galba D.IV or V; 231.33: (1) this, or (2) Galba D.IV

or V.). 
              There is some doubt about the scope and existence of this 
                volume. Both Smith  and Planta in their catalogues list 
                it as missing (respectively ‘Deest’, ‘Desideratur’). In 
                36682  it is entered as ‘Inter Angliam & Belgiam’, but 
                without  the date which   is given for neighbouring 
                entries, and in the checklist of 1656/7 (36682, fol. 1v) it 
                is noted as ‘wanting’. On the other hand, in one of the 
                later seventeenth-century catalogues, London, Inner 
                Temple  Library, MS  Petyt 538/41, it is entered as ‘1 
                Inter Belgiam et Angliam’ with ‘D.6’ in the margin. In 
                contrast with other entries, there is no other volume 
                number   or dating in this entry but those before and 
                after it, for ‘D.5’ and ‘D.7,, read as follows: ‘1 Inter 
                Angliam  et Belgiam  Anno  1589  a Julio ad Dec  28 
                volumen,   and  ‘1 Fasciculus  transmissorum   inter 
                Angliam  et Belgiam Anno  1590. 30 volumen’, a num- 
                bering which  imples no. ‘29’ for D.VI. However, this 
                numbering  is contradicted by entries in the contents- 
                tables which have been written into many of the Galba 
                state paper volumes. In these, Galba D.IV is noted as 
                the 27th volume and  Galba D.VII as the 29th volume. 
                On  this basis, Galba D.V (which has no contents-table 
                now)  must have been the 28th volume, which leaves no 
                room  in this sequence for D.VI. Furthermore, in another 
                of the later catalogues, Bodl., MS Rawlinson D.901 (SC 
                13667), which  post-dates Petyt 538/41, DVI is again 
                marked  ‘Deest’. Taken together, therefore, this evidence 
                raises doubts  without  offering obvious  solutions. 
                Moreover,  in an attempt  to explain D.VI’s absence, 
                Wormald   & Wright suggested some years ago (English 
                Library, p. 203) that it had been lent to Robert Cecil 
                (d. 1612) and never returned. But this, too, presents 
                difficulties. The manuscript that Cecil borrowed (see 
                list 85.2) concerned the years 1586-87 and is therefore 
                more  likely to have been Galba C.X than D.VI which, 
                provided it was correctly placed in the sequence, must 
                have covered the years 1589-90 (although it should also 
               be observed that this is a period which is well served by 
               Galba  DV and VII with no glaring gaps in date between 
                them). On  the other hand - in further support of the 
                existence of  DVI  - by the time  of  the  loans to 
                Whitelocke in 1651/2 (see above), the Galba state paper 
                volumes  were clearly fully bound up and the numbers 
                of manuscripts  recorded as lent to him require the 
                inclusion of D.VI. Moreover, D.VI is most likely the 
                manuscript  separately listed at 231.33 and it may not

have been returned by Whitelocke with the remainder. 
       If, therefore, it did exist and was lost at that time, the 
       dating of that loan may explain the apparent contra- 
       dictions set out above.
