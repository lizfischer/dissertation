   Catalogues: 35213, fol. 37, no. 26 (? this); 6018, no. 360; 
     36789, fol. 157, no. 36; 36682. 
   Fol. 2, ‘Robertus Cotton Bruceus’. 
   Previous ownership: (of fols 10-168, art. 6) William Cecil 
     ((1) this or (2) Otho D.VII or Vesp. A-XXII; 102.1. The 
     annotation  on fol. 335, art. 9, “Mich. de la Poole’, is 
     probably by Cecil.). 
   Previous ownership: (of fols 169-307, art. 7) Thomas and 
     Anthony  Schebber (fol. 307); ? John Hunt (this or Tib. 
     C.VII: BL, Stowe MS  528, fol. 33). 
   Names:  William  West  (fols 210, 307v), Roger Walford 
     (fol. 307v), Geor[ge] Will (fol. 307v). 
   Loans:  Richard Bancroft, 1608, by  hand of John  Pory 
     (29.6: this or Tib. C.VII); James  Ussher, ¢.1610-12 
     (41.7: (1) this or (2) Tib. C.VII; an annotation by Ussher 
     to a copy of a letter of Ralph de Diceto establishes that 
     he was familiar with Claud. E.I11: Bodl., MS Add. C.296 
     (SC  27610), fol. 194); Henry Howard,   c.1612 (21.11, 
     52.6: this or Tib. C.VII); George Buc, 1616 (102.1: this, 
     Otho  D.VH  or Vesp. A.XXII); Benjamin  Jonson, 1621 
     (2.70); William Dugdale, 1639 (183.1: this or Tib. CVI; 
     extracts by Dugdale, dated 1639, probably from C.VII, 
     are in Bodl., MS Dugdale 6 (SC 6496), p. 497.). 
   Simonds  D’Ewes  asked to borrow this manuscript in 1626 
     (82.22), and  William  Burton  requested the loan  of 
     either this or Tib. C.VII in 1627 (Jul. C.III, fol. 51). 
   John Selden used  either fols 10-168, art. 6, of this manu- 
     script or Otho  D.VII in his Historie of Tithes, 1618, 
     noting his source (Radulphus   de Diceto’) as a Cotton

manuscript.  His extract (on pp. 388-89) is to be found 
                 on  fol. 126v of E.III and on fol. 83v of D:VII. For the 
                 similarities between the texts in the two manuscripts 
                 see W. Stubbs, Radulfi de Diceto . . .opera historica, RS, 
                  2 vols (London, 1876), I, p. xcii. Selden’s extract is found 
                 in II, p. 69.

Selden  also used either fols 169-307, art. 7, of this manu- 
                 script or Tib. C.VII in the same work, again noting his 
                 source  (‘Henry  Knighton  Abbot   of  Leicester his 
                 Historie’) as a Cotton manuscript. His extract (on p. 
                 484) differs slightly from the wording of the text in each 
                 manuscript (on fol. 170v of E.III and on fol. 6v of C.VII), 
                 thus making it impossible to state which of the two he 
                 was using. His  earlier extract (on p. 147) does not 
                 appear to have been taken from either manuscript. See 
                 Chronicon Henrici Knighton, ed. by J.R. Lumby, RS, 2 
                 vols (London, 1889, 1895), especially I, pp. 15-16. 
              Augustine  Vincent's reference (‘Knighton Leicestrensis 
                 MS. in bibliotheca Cottoniana, fol. [?]29.b. et sequen), 
                 in his Discoverie of Errours, p. 692, is probably to fol. 
                 177, art. 7, of Claud. E.III or to fols 21v-22 of C.VII. 
              Extracts by Richard  James  in Bodl., MS James  10 (SC 
                 3847), p. 155, are from this manuscript. The annota- 
                 tions on fols 285 and 285v of E.III are by James (and 
                 deal with the power of parliament). There are further 
                 extracts by Brian Twyne in Bodl., MS Twyne 24, pp. 65, 
                 71, 72-74, 77, 79.

Extracts in Bodl., MS Dodsworth  63 (SC 5005), fol. 140, 
                 and in James  Ware's  notebooks, Add.  MS  4793, fols 
                 81-83y, and Bodl., MS Rawlinson B.484 (SC 11831), fol. 
                 36v, may be from either this manuscript or Tib. C.VII.
