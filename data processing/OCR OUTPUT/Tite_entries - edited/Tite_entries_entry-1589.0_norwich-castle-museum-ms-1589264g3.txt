NORWICH,       CASTLE     MUSEUM,       MS  158.926/4g¢3 
           Wyclif, tracts. 
         Fol. 1, ‘Ro: Cotton Conningtonensis. 
         Loans: George Abbot, 1611 (31.1: (1) this, Tit. D.I or XIX, 
           or (2) Dublin,  Trinity College, MS  244  (C.3.12)); 
           Francis Tate, by 1612, John  Harington’s tutor, and 
           William Crashaw  (22.8 and, for Harington’s tutor and 
           Crashaw, 42.1: (2) this, or (1) Tit. D.I, XIX or Dublin, 
           Trinity College, MS 244 (C.3.12)). 
         As the manuscript has a contemporary binding of board 
           covered in pink leather and as this once had a central 
           strap and pin-fastening (Ker, MMBL, III), it seems less 
           likely than the other candidates to be the volume lent at 
           22.8 and 42.1.
