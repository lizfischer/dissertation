CLAUDIUS      AIX 
   Catalogues: no entries. 
   Listed as ‘wanting’, probably in the late 1630s (122.7), and 
     in  the checklist of 1656/7 (‘[not] expressed in the 
     Catalogue  because (as probable) even then  wanting, 
     when  it was made’: 36682, fol. 1). 
   The  probability is that a manuscript with this pressmark 
     never existed, although there is a space for its entry in 
     36682.
