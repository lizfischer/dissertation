VESPASIAN     A.XXII  Ralph de Diceto, history; register of 
            Rochester Priory; etc. 
          Catalogues: 35213, fol. 43v (this, Nero D.II or Faust. B.V); 
            6018, nos 314, 377; 36682 (recorded as missing in the 
            checklist of 1656/7, fol. 1v). 
          Fol. 2, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus’. 
          Previous ownership: John  Dee (Roberts &  Watson, Dee, 
            DM32;   Cotton’s signature on fol. 2 is written over an 
            erased signature, which may be that of John Joscelyn, a 
            suggestion I owe to Elisabeth Leedham-Green.   I am 
            also grateful to David French,  Julian Harrison and 
            David Pearson for helpful comments on the signature.); 
            William  Cecil ((2) this or Otho D.VII, or (1) Claud. 
            E.II1: 102.1. Dee’s ownership makes it unlikely that this 
            manuscript belonged  also to Cecil.).

            Otho  D.VID; John Selden, ? c.1623 or later (6018, no. 
            314; no. 326 (Nero D.VII) was given to Cotton in 1623).
