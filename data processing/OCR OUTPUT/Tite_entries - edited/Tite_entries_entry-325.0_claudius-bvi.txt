CLAUDIUS      BVI Cartulary of Abingdon Abbey, etc. 
    Catalogues: 6018, no. 325; 36682. 
    Previous ownership:  Thomas   Allen (Watson,  ‘Allen of 
      Oxford’, pp. 284  n. 26,  299, 309;  Watson,  Allen's 
      Catalogue, addenda, no. 4). 
    Loan: Richard Montague,  ¢.1620 (Jul. C.III, fols 274, 276: 
      this or Claud. C.IX. For the dating to c.1620, see my 
      ‘Lost or stolen or strayed’, p. 296 n. 39). 
    John Selden used either fol. 150 of this manuscript or fol. 
      159v of Claud. C.IX for the extract (on p. 125) of his

‘Notes upon Sir Ralph de Hengham’ in J. Fortescue, De 
          laudibus  legum Angliae  (London,  1616), citing his 
          source as a Cotton manuscript. The  wording in both 
          manuscripts is identical so that he may have used either, 
          although two of the words he prints are underlined in 
          C.IX. (There is, however, a heavily erased marginal 
          annotation on the relevant folio in B.VI.) 
        He also used this (and Claud. C.IX), listed (ChartularLy] 
          ... of the Abbey of Abingdon’) as a Cotton manuscript, 
          in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. His extracts on p. 208 
          make  it clear that he consulted both manuscripts (they 
          are taken from fol. 12v in B.V1 and fol. 107v in C.TX) but 
          C.IX appears to have been his preferred source (as set 
          out under that entry). 
        Extracts from this (fol. 136v) are in BL, Stowe MS 530, fol. 
          107, where Cotton is noted as owner in 1617. 
        Extracts by Brian Twyne are in Bodl., MS Twyne 22, pp. 
          155-57, and by Richard James from  either this manu- 
          script or Claud. C.IX in Bodl., MS James 8 (SC 3845), 
          p. 71. MS James  24 (SC  3861), p. 3, has extracts ‘ex 
          majori et antiquiori registro monasterii Abingdonensis. 
          collectore Glovero’: of the two Cotton manuscripts, 
          B.VI is the more substantial but C.IX is the older. The 
          collector is presumably Robert Glover. Other extracts, 
          probably made in 1639, are in Bodl., MS Dodsworth 78 
          (SC 5019), fol. 53. 
        See Chronicon monasterii de Abingdon, ed. by J. Stevenson, 
          RS, 2 vols (London, 1858), I, p. xvi, whose references to 
          the early seventeenth-century users of B.VI may, in fact, 
          apply to Claud. C.IX.
