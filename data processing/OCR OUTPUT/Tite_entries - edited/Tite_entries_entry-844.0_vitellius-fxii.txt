* VITELLIUS      FXII  Historical and genealogical collec- 
       tions; etc. 
     Catalogue: 36682. 
     Previous ownership:  (of fols 2-194, artt. 1-11) Arthur 
       Agarde  (75.17: ? this). The hand of fols 95-107, art. 2, 
       wrote the annotation on fol. 50, art. 1. 
     Previous ownership: (of fols 274-393, artt. 14-18) William 
       Camden   (Jul. C.III, fol. 379: ? this). The annotations on 
       fols 322v, 344, artt. 15, 17, are by John Stow. 
     Loans: (of at least fols 2-194, artt. 1-11) Camden, 1612-16 
       (75.17: ? this); (perhaps of fols 274-393, artt. 14-18) 
       Augustine  Vincent, c.1623 (Jul. C.III, fol. 379); John 
       Selden, 1641 (223.2: ? this or ? Vit. F.[X). 
     Fols 195-273, artt. 12, 13, may well be the ‘book of St. 
       Edmund    Bury’ referred to by Henry  Bourchier  in a 
       letter to James Ussher, 17 January 1624/5, as recently. 
       acquired by Cotton: Elrington, Works of Ussher, XV, p. 
       233. The two other possible candidates, in Tib. B.X and 
       Claud. A.XII, are entered in 6018 (as nos 382 and 313), 
      the catalogue begun in 1621. Their appearance there may 
       therefore make  it less likely that either is the manu- 
       script referred to by Bourchier, but on the other hand 
       no. 382 in 6018 cannot have been listed before 1623. 
     Extracts by William Dugdale are in Bodl., MS Dugdale 15 
       (SC 6505), p. 195. 
     It is possible that this manuscript, Vit. F.IV and F:VIII 
       were intermingled after the fire of 1731: see the entry 
       for Appx XXXVIII  in the BL’s ‘Unrevised Descriptions’ 
       of the Cotton Appendix volumes.
