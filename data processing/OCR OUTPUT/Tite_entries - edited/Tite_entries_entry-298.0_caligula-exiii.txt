?* CALIGULA       E.XIII Records  and papers  concerning 
                 England and France, Edward  III to Edward IV; etc. 
              Catalogues: 35213, fol. 40v (? part of this); 36682 (no 
                 entries in the catalogue but (presumably as the former 
                 D.III - see below) recorded as present in the 1656/7 
                 checklist, fol. 1. At the time of the checklist, Calig. E. 
                 consisted of 12 volumes.). 
               Frederic Madden  worked  out that this manuscript had 
                 exchanged places with Calig. D.III (see his annotations 
                 to the Fire Report, reproduced in my edition of Smith’s 
                 Catalogue). E.X11I (entered and described as D.III by 
                 Smith) is not listed by Planta (although he noted that 
                 his D.III was once marked E.XIII and he assumed it ‘to 
                 be a great part of Calig. D.III. which was supposed to 
                 have been lost’).
