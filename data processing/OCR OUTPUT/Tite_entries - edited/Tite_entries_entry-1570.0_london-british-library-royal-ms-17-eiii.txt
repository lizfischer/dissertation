LONDON,     BRITISH   LIBRARY,    ROYAL   MS  17 E.III 
            Le Livre des Propriétés des Choses. 
          Previous ownership: ? Prince Henry, if (2) this or (1) Aug. 
            VI is the manuscript entered by Cotton as one of the 
            ‘Books I want’, c.1609-12 (130.1). However, if this is the 
            manuscript listed in the Richmond Palace inventory of 
            1535  Henry's ownership   is unlikely: see Carley, 
            Libraries of Henry VIII, H1.55.
