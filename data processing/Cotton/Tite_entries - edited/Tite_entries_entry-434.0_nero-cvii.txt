    Previous ownership: (of fols 29-79, artt. 3-12) John Dee 
      (Roberts &  Watson, Dee, M125);  (of the same folios) 
      Simonds  D’Ewes (82.2; Watson, D'Ewes, E72 and p. 23: 
      D’Ewes  took these folios from a manuscript which he

    Previous ownership: (of fols 80-84, art. 13) Robert Talbot,

      no. 360. Cotton's entry in 6018 of St John’s MS 17 makes 
      it certain that he hoped to keep the whole manuscript. 
      When,   at William   Laud’s entreaty  (letter of 22 
      November,  1623, in Jul.C.III, fol. 232), he was prevailed 
      upon  to return it to the college, he retained these 
      folios.).

   As identified by J. Roberts, ‘An inventory of early Guthlac 
     materials, Mediaeval Studies, 32 (1970), 198, the extracts 
     by Richard  James  in Bodl., MS James 18 (SC 3855), 
     P. 50, are from fols 29-40, art. 3, of this manuscript 
     rather than from Vesp, D.XXI. However,  the heading 
     on fol. 29v is by Cotton, not James. 
   On  fol. 1, in James's hand, is the pressmark ‘Claudius 
     D.5. However,  the Nero pressmark  has been entered

(by the scribe who writes in a stylized hand and who is 
                contemporary  with James) on an  unnumbered  flyleaf 
                preceding fol. 1. See also entry for Claud. D.V.
