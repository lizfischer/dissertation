OTHO    DIX  Lives of saints. 
      Catalogues: 35213, fol. 37, no. 32 (this or Tib. E.I); 6018, 
         no. 208 or 201 (208 has been tentatively identified in 
         the catalogue as Otho and 201 as Tib., but as no inven- 
         tory numbers survive in either manuscript this identi- 
         fication, discussed further below, should be treated with 
         caution); 36789, fol. 26; 36682. 
       Loans: Lord William Howard  and  Nicholas Roscarrock, 
         1607 or later to 1612-16 (20.1, 74.4: this or Tib. E.I); ? 
         John Laughton, ? ¢.1634 (137.1). 
       Lord William  Howard  wrote to Cotton  in 1621 (Vesp. 
         F.XIII, no. 318) asking to borrow his manuscript of 
         Johannes Anglicus; the implication of the letter is that 
         neither he nor Roscarrock  had  previously seen the 
         manuscript. The only mention of Johannes Anglicus in 
         the catalogue entries listed above is in 6018, no. 201, 
         where his authorship is noted as an addition to the entry. 
         This (unhappily slender) piece of evidence may there- 
         fore suggest that the manuscript borrowed in loan 20.1 
         was no. 208. The situation is, however, complicated by 
         the fact that Roscarrock, like Cotton, thought that the 
         Nova Legenda Anglie, the borrowing at 20.1, was written 
         by Capgrave  and  supposed that Johannes  Anglicus 
         (now known  to have been John of Tynemouth, the real 
         author of the Nova Legenda) was the same man. I owe 
         this information about Roscarrock to Nicholas Orme. 
       Additional evidence is offered by Oxford, Jesus College 
         MS  77, fols 63-64v, which contains information col-

lected by Augustine Baker, 1637, concerning Tib. E.1. 
    Baker refers to a note then  recently written in the 
    manuscript which gave its author as Johannes Anglicus: 
    see Carley, ‘Royal library’, p. 225 n. 23. (It seems certain 
    that this note survives as fol. 1 of the manuscript. Fol. 1 
    is very badly damaged but sufficient of its text can be 
    read under ultra-violet light to establish that it con- 
    tained some sort of comparison of Capgrave's text with 
    another: for example, one phrase reads ‘. . . hath which 
    Capgrave hath not viz. . ..) This evidence may therefore 
    indicate that 6018, no. 201 (where, as noted above, 
    Johannes is entered as author), is more likely to refer to 
    Tib. than to Otho, but the entry for Tib. in 36682 gives 
    Capgrave rather than Johannes as the author. 
  Simonds D’Ewes  asked to borrow this manuscript or Tib. 
    E.I, 1626 (82.28).

    B.IX).
