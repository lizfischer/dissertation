VITELLIUS     D.IV John  Paleonydorus, Liber de Ordine 
            Carmelitico; etc. 
          Catalogues: 6018, nos 134 (except for Smith artt. 1, 2 and 
            9), 338; 36789, fols 38v-39; 36682. 
          Previous ownership:  (of Smith  artt. 1, 2 and_,9, all 
            destroyed in 1731) John Bale (Smith, Catalogue). As 
            Smith’s entry establishes Bale’s authorship of the first 
            and last articles and as, in McCusker’s opinion, artt. 5 
            and 7 were probably among the manuscripts he owned 
            in Ireland (the latter being the likely source of his In 
            mantuanum   de morte), it would seem almost certain 
            that the whole of D.IV was once owned by him. See H. 
            McCusker, John  Bale: dramatist and antiquary (Bryn 
            Mawr,  1942), pp. 46, 102-3. 
          Smith art. 3, the bulk of the surviving portion, was entered 
            by Planta in his Catalogue as Appx. XXXVII, art. 1.
