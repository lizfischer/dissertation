* or ** CALIGULA    D.III Records and papers concerning 
             England, France, Flanders, ete., Henry III to Henry IV. 
           Catalogue: 35213, fol. 40v (? part of this). 
           Frederic Madden  worked  out that this manuscript had 
             exchanged  places with Calig. E.XIII (see his annota- 
             tions to the fire Report, reproduced in my edition of 
             Smith's Catalogue). The  former  D.III  (which was 
             entered under that pressmark by Smith) had not been 
             listed by Planta (although he noted that his D.III was 
             once marked  E.XIII and he assumed  it ‘to be a great 
             part of Calig. D.III. which was supposed to have been 
             lost’). The manuscript recorded as present in the check- 
             list of 1656/7 (36682, fol. 1), though not listed in the 
             catalogue in 36682  itself, is presumably the former 
             DI. 
           The present D.III contains organizational notes by Cotton 
             but the fact that Smith did not catalogue it presumably 
             indicates either that he overlooked it or that it was not 
             then shelved in the Emperor sequence. (It was, however, 
already bound up, in some form, at the time of the 
       1656/7 checklist.) 
     Fols 91-101, art. 35, are in Ralph Starkey’s hand.
