               Catalogues: 35213, fol. 43 (? this, Vesp. D.XIV or Faust. 
                 A.IX); 36682. This (or Faust. A.[X) may be the unidenti- 
                 fied no, 228 in 6018: ‘Homelia Alfrici saxonice’. 
               Fol. 1, ‘Cott’, presumably the remains of Cotton's signature, 
                 in the top left-hand corner of the damaged leaf. As Ker 
                 states (Catalogue of Anglo-Saxon MSS,  no. 220), this 
                 leaf has been reversed in binding (the medieval  con- 
                 tents-table is on fol. 1v): the position of Cotton's signa- 
                 ture, if such this is, suggests that the leaf was already 
                 reversed when  he signed it.
