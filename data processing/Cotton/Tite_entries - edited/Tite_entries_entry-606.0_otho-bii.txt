OTHO    B.II Gregory, Pastoral Care. 
     Catalogue: 36682. 
     Previous ownership: John  Rogerius, William Bowyer, 
       Henry Elsyng who  gave the manuscript to Cotton, 6 
       October 1597 (Ker, Catalogue of Anglo-Saxon MSS, no. 
       175, quoting from Wanley, Catalogus, p. 217). 
     The annotation at the foot of fol. 42v is probably by John 
       Joscelyn. He certainly knew the manuscript: see R.I. 
       Page, Matthew Parker and his Books (Kalamazoo, 1993, 
       pp. 102-3.). 
     Part of this manuscript was catalogued by Planta as Appx 
       XLIII (see Frederic Maddenâ€™s annotations to the Fire 

       Report).
