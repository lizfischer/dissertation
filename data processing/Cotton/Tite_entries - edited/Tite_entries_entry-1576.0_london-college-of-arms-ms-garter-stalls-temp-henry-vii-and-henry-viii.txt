LONDON,     ‘COLLEGE     OF  ARMS    MS.   GARTER 
      STALLS    TEMP.   HENRY     VII  AND    HENRY 
      VIII’ (the spine title). 
    Perhaps the manuscript owned by William Dethick (d. 
      1612) and then in the hands of Jacob Chaloner, from 
      whom Cotton temporarily acquired it, c.1616 (78.1, 133.3). 
    This folio manuscript is in the hand of Sir Thomas 
      Wriothesley but was rebound in the nineteenth century. 
      There are no traces of earlier binding or early owner- 
      ship and it is housed at the College of Arms in a press 
      of Garter material of all periods. It is not apparently 
      listed in the catalogue of the College library made in 
      1618/19 (College of Arms, MS L. 11, part II) but it could 
      have come into the library at a later date. Its possible 
      identification as the manuscript at 78.1, 133.3 must 
      therefore be regarded as tentative. I am very grateful to 
      Mr Robert Yorke, Archivist at the College of Arms, for 
      much  help and advice on this identification and for 
      examining the manuscript and the catalogue. 
    For a description of the manuscript, see Wagner, CEMRA, 
      p. 123.
