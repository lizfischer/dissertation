OTHO    C.XII Statuta Angliae; etc. 
         Catalogue: 6018,  no. 308  (where the entry has  been 
           wrongly identified as Otho C.XIII). 
         Previous ownership: Francis Tate (fol. 1v). 
         The  manuscript  was one  of those, among a  group of 
           Grosseteste manuscripts, lent or given by Cotton to 
           Westminster Abbey  library, probably at much the same 
           time as John Williams, then dean, was endowing and 
           re-equipping it in 1623: Robinson &  James, MSS  of 
          Westminster  Abbey, pp. 27, 35-36 (where it is wrongly 
           identified as Otho D.XI). Smith, Catalogue, ‘To the 
           Reader’, p. 24, notes the recovery of the manuscripts 
           after 60 years’ absence. See also Teviotdale, ‘Classified 
           catalogues’, pp. 201, 205 n. 51. 
         Grosseteste manuscripts were the subject of a letter from 
           William Barlow, bishop of Lincoln, to Cotton in 1609: 
           Jul. C.II, fol. 19.
