LONDON,     LAMBETH     PALACE,    MSS  53, 54 Nicholas 
      Harpsfield, Historia Anglicana ecclesiastica. 
    Previous ownership: Lord Lumley (MS 53, fol. 5; MS 54, 
      fol. 1. See also Jayne & Johnson, Lumley Library, no. 
      1344); ? Prince Henry, c.1609-12 (130.16). 
    The signatures indicate that the work was in two volumes 
      in Lumley’s time. This must therefore have been the 
      copy of Harpsfield that Cotton listed in “Books I want’, 
      ¢.1609-12 (130.16), where two volumes are specified. 
      The binding of the volumes together in their present 
      form probably occurred in Archbishop Sancroft’s time: 
      MLR. James, A Descriptive Catalogue of the Manuscripts 
      in the Library of  Lambeth Palace. The  mediaeval 
      manuscripts (Cambridge, 1932). The volumes were in 
      Archbishop  Bancroft’s hands  before his death  in 
      November  1610 as they are listed in his catalogue, now 
      Lambeth  Palace, Library Records F.1, fol. 69. 
    There are annotations throughout both volumes (e.g. MS 
      53, fols 174v-75; MS 54, fol. 9) in a hand very similar 
      to, but probably not, that of Patrick Young. 
    I am very grateful to Dr Richard Palmer, Librarian of 
      Lambeth  Palace Library, for being permitted to exam- 
      ine these volumes.
