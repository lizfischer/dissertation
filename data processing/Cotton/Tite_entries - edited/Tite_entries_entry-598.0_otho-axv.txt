          The  omission of the manuscript from 36682 accounts for 
             the discrepancy between its numbering of subsequent 
             Otho A. manuscripts and that in Smith's Catalogue If, 
             as Carley has argued, art. 1 of this manuscript came 
             from the Royal library, it is most likely to have been 
             acquired during Cotton's lifetime and ‘would therefore 
             have been available for cataloguing in 36682.
