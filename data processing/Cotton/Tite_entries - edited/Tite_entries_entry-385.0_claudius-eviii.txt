CLAUDIUS       EVIII   Flores  Historiarum;  Adam    of 
           Murimuth,  chronicle; etc. 
         Catalogues: 6018, no. 215 (on fols 100, 103); 36789, fol. 
           15v (? this); 36682. 
         Fol. 5, ‘Robertus Cotton Bruceus’. 
         Previous ownership: ? Henry  Savile (Watson, Savile of 
           Banke, no. 22, but see below); Robert Bowyer, c.1612

(13.15, 37.3). 
         Loan:  Richard Bancroft, 1608, by  hand  of Zachariah 
           Pasfeild (29.13). The conflict between the date of this 
           loan and  that of Bowyer’s ownership  has yet to be 
           resolved: it is possible that  the manuscript   was 
           temporarily in Cotton's hands in 1608. 
         The Murimuth   chronicle in this manuscript is that listed 
           by John Joscelyn in Nero C.III, fol. 211v, as owned by 
           “Mr Boyer’, a record subsequently annotated ‘R. Cotton’ 
           by  Cotton  himself  (see also Graham   &   Watson, 
           Recovery of the Past, p. 43 n. 112, and J.2.105); and 
           although Joscelyn does not mention the previous article, 
           the Flores Historiarum, entry 13.15 makes it clear that 
           it must also have belonged to Robert Bowyer. In any 
           case, despite a separate sixteenth-century foliation for 
           the Murimuth,   the manuscript  is a unity. Joscelyn’s 
           entry also listed another chronicle running from 1320 
           to 1380, now Oxford, Queen's College, MS 304 (Graham 
           & Watson, J2.105). The annotations on fol. 144 and the 
           following leaves could well be  by William  Bowyer, 
           Robert's father; the marginal mark on fol. 246 of three 
           dots surmounting   a comma   is one-used  by Robert 
           (Proceedings in Parliament 1610, ed. by E.R. Foster, 2 
           vols (New Haven  and London,  1966), I, p. xxii). If this 
           manuscript  was owned  by both of the Bowyers, father 
           and  son, it is unlikely also to have belonged to Savile 
           and  indeed Watson appears to have discarded Savile’s 
           possible ownership in Graham & Watson, J2.105. There 
           are annotations by Joscelyn on fols 200, 200v. 
         According to Hardy, Descriptive Catalogue, 111, 313, the 
           manuscript  was used by John Stow.
