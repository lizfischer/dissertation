ete. 
       Catalogues: 6018,  no. 209 (art. 1 only) and no.  270; 
         36682. 
       Fol. 127v, art. 3, ‘Ro Cotton’. 
       Fols 113-27, artt. 2 and 3, were known to John Stow: see 
         M.  McKisack,  Medieval  History  in the Tudor  Age 
         (Oxford, 1971), p. 84. Davis, MC, no. 616, suggests that 
         Stow may  have owned  these articles. 
       In the margin of 6018, against the entry for no. 209, Cotton 
         has written ‘an other book of Venic must be added to 
         this: Mr Vincent’. The reference is to art. 5 and must be 
         to Augustine Vincent who may  have had it on loan. 
       Extracts, marked as from this manuscript, are in James 
         Ware's  notebook, Bodl., MS   Rawlinson  B.484  (SC 
         11831), fol. 37.
