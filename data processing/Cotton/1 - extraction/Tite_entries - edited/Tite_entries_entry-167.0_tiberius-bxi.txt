       Part of this manuscript was catalogued by Planta as Appx 
         XLIV  (see Frederic Madden's annotations to the Fire 
         Report). The leaves were reunited with B.XI but the 
         whole  manuscript, which had been burnt in 1731, was 
         further damaged  in the Fire of 1865.
