For a suggestion that this manuscript (or Cambridge, 
                 Corpus Christi College, MS 408) might have belonged 
                to  John Bale, see Graham & Watson,  Recovery of the 
                 Past, J2.118 (whose folio numbering for A-VIII is, how- 
                 ever, incorrect).
