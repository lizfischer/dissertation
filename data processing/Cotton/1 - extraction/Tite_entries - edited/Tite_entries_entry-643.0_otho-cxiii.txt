         The manuscript was one of those lent or given by Cotton 
           to Westminster Abbey  library, probably at much the 
           same time as John Williams, then dean, was endowing 
           and re-equipping it in 1623: Robinson & James, MSS of 
           Westminster Abbey, pp. 27, 34. Smith, Catalogue, “To 
           the Reader’, p. 24, notes the recovery of the manuscripts 
           after 60 years’ absence. See also Teviotdale, ‘Classified 
           catalogues’, pp. 201, 205 n. 51.
