          Used by John Selden and listed as a Cotton manuscript in 
            his Historie of Tithes, 1618. The manuscript is badly 
            damaged  but the first of Selden’s references (p. 210, ‘de 
            Decimis’) may be taken from fol. 133v. 
          There are extracts by James Ussher  in Dublin, Trinity 
            College, MS 780  (D.3.10). Referred to by him in his 
            Britannicarum   ecclesiarum  antiquitates  (Dublin, 
            1639), p. 557. 
          Extracts, marked as from this manuscript, are in James 
            Ware's notebook,  Bodl., MS   Rawlinson  B.479 (SC 
            11826), fol. 78.
