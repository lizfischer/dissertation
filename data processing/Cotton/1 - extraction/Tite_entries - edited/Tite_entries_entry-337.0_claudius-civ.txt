CLAUDIUS   C.IV  Transcript of Red Book of the Exchequer. 
              Catalogue: 36682. 
              Fols 2, 3, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus’. 
              Previous ownership: William Cecil (fol. 2); John Guillim 
                (13.5). However, this provenance  is not clear-cut: 
                Cotton's annotation on fol. 2 states that he received it 
                from Cecil but in the loan to Robert Bowyer (13.5) he 
                says that he had borrowed it from Guillim. The manu- 
                script itself is probably in Guillim’s hand. 
              Loans: Bowyer, ¢.1612 (13.5, 36.7), 1621 (2.43); Guillim, 
                1612-15 (19.1: ? this).
