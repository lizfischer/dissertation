                SUPRA   63 (SC 3451) Laurence Nowell, Vocabularium 
                Saxonicum. 
              Robert Cotton borrowed this manuscript from Multon 
                Lambarde  and lent it to Francis Tate, 1612-16 (73.7). 
                The loan was still extant until after Tate’s death in 1616 
                (111.12), and the manuscript was used by Francis Junius 
                and Simonds D’Ewes, and then passed to John Selden.
