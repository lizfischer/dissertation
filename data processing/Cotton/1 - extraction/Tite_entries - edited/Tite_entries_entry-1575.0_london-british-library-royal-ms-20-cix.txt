LONDON,     BRITISH    LIBRARY,     ROYAL    MS  20 
      C.IX Jean Chartier, Cronique du Charles VII Roy de 
      France. 
    This is probably the manuscript returned by Cotton to 
      Patrick Young, c.1616 (134.36). The heading on fol. 1 
      and the annotations on fols 13v and 311 are almost 
      certainly in Cotton's hand.
