TIBERIUS C.XIII John Brompton,  chronicle. 
           Catalogues: 6018, no. 376; 36682. 
           Fol. 3, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus’. 
           Previous ownership: there is an ex dono inscription of 
             1604, with an erased name, on fol. 256v. 
           Loans: Richard  Bancroft, 1608, by hand  of Zachariah 
             Pasfeild (9.1); James Ussher, ¢.1610-12 (41.1); John 
             Hayward, ? 1611 (63.1); George Buc, 1611 + (69.1); St Lo 
             Kniveton, 1615-16, by 1617 (45.14, 111.36); John Selden, 
             1640 (208.4). 
           Selden asked to borrow this manuscript in 1615 (Jul. C.II, 
             fol. 338). He used it and listed it (Historia Iornallensis, 
             written by John Brampton’) as a Cotton manuscript in 
             his Historie of Tithes, 1618. His extracts, printed on 
             PP. 213, 214-15, 215, 219-20, 222 and 223-24, are from 
             fols 46v, 50, 52v, 57, 68-68v and 74, respectively, of the 
             manuscript. In 1625 Selden was also seeking to borrow 
             the ‘Historia Jornallensis, presumably Cotton's manu- 
             script, which he believed might then be temporarily 
             in Ussher’s possession: Elrington, Works of Ussher, XV, 
             p. 302 and (for Cotton’s ownership) 290. 
           Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peirese was hoping for Cotton’s 
             consent to print part of the manuscript, 1618 (Smith, 
             Camden's Correspondence, p. 261). 
           Richard Montague  asked to borrow this manuscript (Jul. 
             C.Il, fol. 274, a letter which although undated was 
             probably written shortly before 1621 as it mentions the 
             Burton annals, Vesp. E.III, which Montague borrowed 
             in that year). 
           Simonds  D’Ewes asked to borrow  the manuscript, 1626 
             (82.16).

This may have been one of the John Brompton manuscripts 
       that William Watts returned to Selden (cf. loan 208.4, 
       above) in November 1640, having despaired of produc- 
       ing an edition because of the troubled times: see J.A.F. 
       Bekkers, Correspondence of John Morris with Johannes 
       de Laet (1634-1649) (Assen, 1970), letter no. 22, a refer- 
       ence and suggestion I owe to Gerald Toomer. Selden had 
       some control over the Cotton library during the 1640s. 
     Extracts by Richard James are in Bodl., MS James 10 (SC 
       3847), p. 95, where the source is wrongly stated as Tib. 
       C.XVI, a manuscript  that does not exist. There are 
       further extracts by Brian Twyne in Bodl., MS Twyne 24, p. 1.

     The text of the manuscript was printed by Roger Twysden 
       in his Historiae Anglicanae scriptores decem (London, 
       1652). In ‘Lectori’, sig. 3.A, he records Selden’s help in 
       securing borrowings from the Cotton library. 
     Binding leaves in Royal MS 13 D.I*. 
     Sharpe, Cotton, p. 51, is incorrect in stating that this 
       manuscript came  into the library after Cotton’s death.
