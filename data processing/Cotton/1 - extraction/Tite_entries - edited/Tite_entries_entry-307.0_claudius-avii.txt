CLAUDIUS       AVII   (=  FAUSTINA    B.II  Cartulary  of 
           Clerkenwell Priory; etc.) 
         Catalogues: no entries. 
         Listed as ‘wanting’, probably in the late 1630s (122.6), and 
           in the  checklist of 1656/7 (‘[not] expressed in the 
           Catalogue  because (as probable) even  then wanting, 
           when  it was made’: 36682, fol. 1). 
         From  an early date, this manuscript was given the press- 
           mark  Faust. B.II (Royal MS 13 D.I*, fol. 34, formerly 
           the last leaf of Faust B.II, is also marked Claud. A:VII, 
           as noted also at the front of 13 D.I*). For a fuller expla- 
           nation, see the entry for Faust B.II. It is likely that no 
           separate manuscript  with the Claud. A.VII pressmark 
           ever existed, although there is a space for it in 36682.
