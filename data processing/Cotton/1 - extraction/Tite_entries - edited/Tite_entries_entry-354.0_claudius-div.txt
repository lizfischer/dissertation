            Catalogues: 6018, no. 200; 36789, fols 134v-35; 36682. 
            Fol. 3, ‘Robert Cotton’, ‘Robertus Cotton Bruceus’. 
            John Selden used a ‘life of St Cuthbert’, listed as a Cotton 
              manuscript,  in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. Selden’s 
              reference (on p. 282) is to ‘... the life ... written by 
              some  Monk  under Hen.  I. . ., so that fols 90-115y, art. 
              2, in D.IV which are by Reginald (who, however, lived 
              under  Henry II) are probably his source. Nevertheless, 
              other possibilities are Nero A.II, artt. 7, 8, or Vit. E.I, 
              Fire Report art 11. 
            The annotation on fol. 34, ‘Vide in Registro de Waltham 
              in vita Regis Haroldi cap: 5°, may well be in Lord 
              William Howard's  hand. The reference is to Harl. MS 
              3776, a manuscript owned by Howard,  which contains 
              the unique copy of the Vita Haroldi. 
            Extracts by Brian Twyne are in Bodl., MS Twyne 24, pp. 
              53, 56.
