*   VITELLIUS      CVIII    Letters  of  Adam    Marsh; 
       Boncompagnus;  life of St Kentigern; ete. 
    Catalogues: 6018, no. 169; 36789, fols 36-36v; 36682. 
    Previous ownership: (of fols 4-21, artt. 1-3, fols 165-212, 
       art. 12) Henry Savile (Watson, Savile of Banke, nos 2

and  15). 
    Loans:  Patrick Young, ¢.1616 (49.17); Augustine Baker, 
      after 1623 (6018, no. 169); ? James Ussher, 1641 (221.1); 
      William  Dugdale, 1653 (244.1). 
    ‘The remainder of the manuscript, of which fols 4-21, artt. 
      1-3, formed  part, is now Royal MS  6 C.-VIII. As the 
      manuscript  was in its complete form when owned  by 
      Savile, it is likely that Cotton was responsible for split- 
      ting it up (see Watson, Savile of Banke, no. 2, and also 
      Ker, MLGB,  p. 159. Watson's entry for his 2(d) should 
      read ‘Royal 6 C.VIII, fols. 123-33 + Vit. C.VII, fols. 
      6r-va’, because a fragment of Dares Phrygius is bound 
      into C.VIIL). 
    Fols 157-64 once belonged with what is now Claud. C.VI, 
      fols 1 and 205 (see note by Frederic Madden on fol. 157). 
      It is not known whether Cotton was responsible for the 
      separation. 
    Brian Twyne  made  extracts from fols 26-84, art. 5, in 
      Bodl., MS Twyne  22, p. 294. 
    Richard  James made  extracts from this manuscript  in 
      Bodl., MS James 28 (SC 3865), pp. 64-68. 
    The note, in Richard James's hand, on fol. 2 of Tit. A-XIV 
      (‘De quodam  Thoma   Wyke. Vide  epistolam Adam  de 
      Maresco  epistolarum eius fol. 110°) may refer to the 
      collection of letters in this manuscript, but the letter 
      relating to a Thomas Wykes is on fols 67-67v of C.VIII 
      and there is no evidence that that leaf may once have 
      been numbered   110. 
    The sequence of the first three articles in the manuscript 
      differs from that given in the catalogues of Smith and 
      Planta, and in Richard James's contents-table in the 
      manuscript  itself. However, these cataloguers must 
      have  erred because the sequence  is that set out in 
      Savile’s catalogue.
