VITELLIUS     CII  Abstract of the reliefs paid by the king’s 
     tenants-in-chief, Edward I to Edward IV. 
   Catalogues: 36789, fol. 78; 36682. 
   Fol. 423y, final page of main text, ‘Ro: Cotton huntington- 
     ensis’, probably a signature. 
   On  fol. 2, below the contents-table, is written ‘In Mr 
     Osburn’s Office’ (s.xvii), presumably a reference to the 
     roll, of which this manuscript is a copy, held (according 
     to   Planta,  Catalogue)  in  the   Lord  Treasurer's 
     Remembrancer’s   office. For the Osbornes, father, son 
     and  grandson, see Index of Names.
