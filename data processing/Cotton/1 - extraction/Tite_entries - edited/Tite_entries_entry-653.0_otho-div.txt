OTHO    D.IV Collections of Robert Glover. 
     Catalogues: 36789, fols 15v-16 (contents specified as far 
       as art. 6); 36682 (except for artt. 6-11). 
     Previous ownership: William Cecil (according to Smith,

Catalogue) 
     Fols 1-222, artt. 1-10, are largely in Glover's hand. 
     As Frederic Madden   noted, fols 1-95, part of art. 1, were 
       wrongly  entered by Planta as Vit. F:VIII. Plantaâ€™s folia- 
       tion is therefore incorrect.
