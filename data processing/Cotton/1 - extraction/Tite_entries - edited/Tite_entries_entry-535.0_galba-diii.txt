* GALBA    D.III Records and  papers concerning England 
      and the Low Countries, 1588-89. 
    Catalogues: 35213,  fol. 40v (? this); 36789,  fols 6, 
      155v,163; 36682. 
    Previous ownership: Fols 157-58vy, art. 55, fols 201-204, 
      art. 72, may have come to Cotton among manuscripts 
      he acquired from Robert  Beale (36.14). Fol. 204v is, 
      however, annotated by William Cecil. 
    Previous ownership: The papers of Robert Dudley, earl of 
      Leicester, in this volume (and in others) may be among 
      those that Cotton ‘had of Sir Arthur Aty’ (see Galba 
      CNII, fol. 375v, following art. 141) or of ‘my Cosen Sir 
      John Dormer’ (see Galba C.X, fol. 72v, art. 27). See also 
      Galba D.II, fol. 308, art. 126. 
    Fols 88-94, art. 35, fols 287-90y, art. 109, are in the hand 
      of a scribe who worked for Cotton. 
    Loan: Bulstrode Whitelocke, 1652 (231.24). 
   A  numbering  of articles in this and other state paper 
     volumes  in a sequence which is not that of the modern 
      order is probably a reflection of the arrangement of 
      papers in bundles which preceded the modern binding. 
      Some of the numbering may  be by William Dugdale. 
   Organizational notes by Cotton.
