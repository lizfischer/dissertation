            the manuscript was reshelved as Vesp. A.I (checklist of 
            1656/7, fol. Iv: â€˜A.21. blotted in the Catalogue, because 
            remooved  to A.1. and there found. That which formerly 
            was A.1. (the Contents whereof are in a loose sheete:) is 
            wanting.). There is no evidence that any other manu- 
            script was subsequently shelved at A.XXI.
