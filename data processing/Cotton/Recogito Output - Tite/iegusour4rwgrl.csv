This loan to de Laet was arranged, after               some  hesitation, by Selden, at the request of John               Morris, at a time when the door to the Cotton library               was boarded up. Selden sent the manuscript to Claudius               Salmasius, not direct to de Laet (who  published an               edition of Vitruvius in 1649). It was then entrusted to               James Golius when  Salmasius  left for Sweden in July               1650 and  subsequently, with Selden’s consent, passed               on to Marcus Meibomius.  It remained in Meibomius’s               hands (with a manuscript from Selden’s own collection)               until at least February 1652. The date of its retrieval by               the Cotton library is not known but Selden’s own manu-               script had been returned to him before his death in               1654.","char-offset:780","","","","","","","","","Loan","","",""
