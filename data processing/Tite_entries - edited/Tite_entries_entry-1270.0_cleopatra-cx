* CLEOPATRA       C.X Chronicle  of Ralph Niger; matters 
       relating to the city of Norwich; ete. 
    Catalogues: 36789, fols 156 (? for art. 2), 156v, no. 13 (for 
       art. 1); 36682. 
    Previous ownership: (of fols 2-56, artt. 1 + part of 2, fols 
       ‘71-100, art. 4) Thomas Allen, 1622 (Watson, ‘Allen of 
       Oxford’, p. 309). Fols 67-70, remainder of art. 2, must 
       also have belonged to Allen as they form a unit with fols 
       2-56 from which  they are separated by a mistakenly 
       inserted quire (fols 57-66, art. 3). 
    Previous  ownership:  (of fols 57-66, art. 3) Simonds 
       D’Ewes, 1626 (if this is the manuscript listed at 82.13: 
      Watson, D'Ewes, pp. 23-24. Watson  points out that the 
      corner of fol. 66 of the manuscript appears to have been 
      turned down, as noted in the entry at 82.13. Fols 64 and 
      65 seem  to have been treated in the same manner.). 
    Loans: (of fols 71-100, art. 4, of this or Tib. A.V) Thomas 
      Brudenell, 1627 (Vesp. F.XTII, no. 329); John Selden,
