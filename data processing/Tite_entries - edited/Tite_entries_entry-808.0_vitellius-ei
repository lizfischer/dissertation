          (where Smith  art. 5 is listed at the end of the manu- 
          script). 
        Previous ownership:  Henry  Savile (Watson, Savile of 
          Banke, no. 14). 
        John Selden used a ‘life of St Cuthbert, listed as a Cotton 
          manuscript, in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. Selden’s 
          reference (on p. 282) is to‘... the life ... written by 
          some  Monk  under  Hen. I.. 2, so that art. 2 in Claud. 
          D.IV which  is by Reginald (who, however, lived under 
          Henry  II) is probably his source. Nevertheless, other 
          possibilities are E. I, Fire Report  art. 11 (badly 
          damaged),  or Nero A.II, artt. 7, 8. 
        Ms  discussed by Smith  in his ‘History and Synopsis’, 
          Catalogue, p. 54, in connection with James Ware's work 
          on  the lives of the abbots of Monkwearmouth    and 
          Jarrow. 
        Fols 1, 2 of Vit. E.VII belong to this manuscript, as do five 
         small fragments  now bound, with others, as Fragments 
          XXX,  but retaining the previous nomenclature of Misc. 
          Burnt Fragments, Bundle  I (12).
