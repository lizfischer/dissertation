TIBERIUS D.IX   John  de  Castro, voyages  of  the 
      Portuguese round Africa. 
    Catalogues: 36789, fol. 146; 36682. 
    It has been suggested that this manuscript, which is in 
      Portuguese, is likely to be the original bought by Walter 
      Raleigh for £60: Wormald & Wright, English Library, 
      p. 197; Samuel  Purchas, Hakluytus  posthumus   or 
      Purchas His Pilgrimes, 4 vols (London, 1625), II, p. 
      1122. I owe the latter reference to Ruth Wright. Purchas 
      also states that Raleigh had an English translation 
      done. An alternative provenance has, however, been 
      advanced by Timothy Graham  who argues convincingly 
      that the  manuscript  was  probably  secured  from 
      Edmund  Hakluyt who was persuaded by William L'sle 
      to present it to Cotton rather than to Trinity College, 
      Cambridge. See T. Graham, ‘L'Isle’s letters to Cotton’, 
      pp. 367-68  (printing Harl. MS  7000,  fol. 92). In 
      exchange for securing it, Cotton was expected to pro- 
      vide a manuscript of Grosseteste. Graham suggests that 
      the Grosseteste manuscript may be Cambridge, Trinity 
      College, MS B.15.20, but, as he points out, there is no 
      evidence of Cottonian ownership in it. It had earlier 
      belonged to contemporaries of Cotton - Henry Howard, 
      earl of Northampton, John Dee  and Henry  Savile of 
      Banke (not necessarily in that order) - and was listed 
      as a Trinity manuscript in CMA. See Watson, Savile of 
      Banke, no. 16; Roberts & Watson, Dee, M63 and p. 58;

      in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge, 4 vols
