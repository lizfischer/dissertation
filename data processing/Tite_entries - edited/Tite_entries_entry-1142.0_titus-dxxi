          Catalogues: 36789, fols 167-67v. No entry in 36682  but 
            the checklist of 1656/7, fol. 2, reads: â€˜... D.21... noe 
            contents  in Catalogue;  nor  figures, (after 20) but

figures, and contents, in the bookes, which are all there, 
      in their places.. 
    The bulk of the manuscript is almost certainly in the hand 
      of Nicholas Charles.
