              Catalogues: 35213, fol. 37, no. 26 ( ? this); 6018, no. 166; 
                36789,  fol. 52v; 36682. 
              Fol. 3, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus’ 
              Previous ownership: John  Hunt  (of this or Claud. E.III: 
                 BL, Stowe MS  528, fol. 33). 
              Name:  ? ‘William < > Longe’ (fol. 239v). 
              Loans:  Richard Bancroft, 1608, by hand  of John  Pory 
                (29.6: this or Claud. E.III); James Ussher, ¢.1610-12 
                (41.7: (2) this or (1) Claud. E.III; an annotation by 
                Ussher  to a copy of a letter of Ralph de Diceto estab- 
                lishes that he was familiar with Claud. E.III: Bodl., MS 
                Add. C.296 (SC 27610), fol. 194); Henry Howard, ¢.1612

(21.11, 52.6: this or Claud. E.III); John Selden, 1621, 
      and  Augustine Vincent (2.68); William Dugdale,  1639 
      (183.1: this or Claud. E.III; extracts by Dugdale, dated 
      1639, probably from  C.VII, are in Bodl., MS Dugdale 6 
      (SC 6496), p. 497). 
    This or Claud. E.III used by  Selden and  listed (‘Henry 
      Knighton  Abbot  of Leicester his Historie’) as a Cotton 
      manuscript  in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. His extract 
      (on p. 484) differs slightly from the wording of the text 
      in each manuscript (on fol. 6v of C.VII and on fol. 170v 
      of E.II1), thus making it impossible to state which of the 
      manuscripts he was using. His earlier extract (on p. 147) 
      does not appear to have been taken from either manu- 
      script. See Chronicon  Henrici Knighton,  ed. by J.R. 
      Lumby,  Rolls Series 92, 2 vols (London, 1889, 1895), 
      especially I, pp. 15-16. 
    Augustine  Vincent's reference (‘Knighton  Leicestrensis 
      MS.  in bibliotheca Cottoniana, fol. [?]29.b. et sequen.’), 
      in his Discoverie of Errours, p. 692, is probably to fols 
      21v-22  of C.VII or to fol. 177 of Claud. E.III. 
    William Burton  requested a loan of this or Claud. E.ITT in 
      1627: Jul. C.1H, fol. 51. 
    Extracts in Bodl., MS Dodsworth  63 (SC 5005), fol. 140, 
      and  in James Ware's  notebooks, Add.  MS  4793, fols 
      81-83y, and Bodl., MS Rawlinson  B.484 (SC 11831), fol. 
      36v, may be from either this manuscript or Claud. E.IIT.
