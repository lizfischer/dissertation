     Previous ownership:  (of fols 2v-53v, artt. 1, 2) ‘William 
       Hervy  alias Clarenceulx’ (fol. 2); (of fols 54-60, art. 3)

       The annotation  on fol. 63, art. 6 (at the head of the text, 
       below  the title in Cotton's hand) is by Joscelyn; those 
       on, e.g., fols 66, 67, art. 6, are by Christopher Watson.

       4-6, of this or ? (2) Tit. AIT). 
     In his Historie of Tithes, 1618, Selden prints (on p. 276) 
       an extract which he says is closely similar to a report - 
       found in two manuscripts, one owned  by Thomas  Allen 
       and  the  other by  Cotton -  on  ‘Eadbert Bishop  of 
       Lindisfarn’, written by ‘Turgot Prior of Durham, that 
       wrote the story of that Bishoprique’. The Allen manu- 
       script used by Selden was what later became Faust. A.V 
       but his Cottonian  source has yet to be firmly estab- 
       lished: his reference (which is not a precise quotation 
       from  this source) is found both in A.VI, fol. 66, and in 
       Tit. ALII, fol. 16, and neither folio has marginal mark- 
       ings which might have  indicated his use. 
     Names:  ‘Abraham  Browne’ (fol. 54); John Myson’, ‘Matho 
       Myson’  (fol. 69).
