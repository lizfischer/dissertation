OTHO    B.VI Genesis. 
            Catalogues: 6018, no. 267; 36682 and noted as missing in 
              the checklist of 1656/7, fol. 1v. 
            Previous ownership:  Henry   VIII, Elizabeth I, John 
              Fortescue (according to the entry in Smith's Catalogue, 
              which also notes that Thomas Wakefeld (d. 1575), Regius 
              Professor of Hebrew at Cambridge, wrote his name on 
              the final page of the manuscript). Nicolas-Claude Fabri 
              de Peiresc said that James I gave the manuscript to 
              Cotton. (K. Weitzmann  &  H.L.  Kessler, The Cotton 
              Genesis (Princeton, 1986), p. 4, discuss both proposi- 
              tions and conclude that either Fortescue or James I 
              could have given the manuscript to Cotton. However, 
              they do not note that Smith himself had rejected the 
              claim  that James  I  had  owned  the  manuscript: 
              Catalogue, ‘History and Synopsis’, p. 57 n. 1. For the lat- 
              est assessment of its pre-Cottonian ownership, see J. P. 
              Carley, ‘Thomas Wakefield, Robert Wakefield and the 
              Cotton  Genesis,  Transactions  of the  Cambridge 
              Bibliographical Society, 12, 3 (2002), 246-65.) 
            Loans: Sir  Henry  Savile, 1611 (Jul. C.III, fol. 333; 
              Weitzmann  &  Kessler seem to have been unaware of 
              this loan; Savile's letter to Cotton in Jul. C.III gives an 
              interesting description of the manuscript, already by 
              then damaged.   See also  my  Appendix  to  Carley, 
              ‘Wakefield’); Patrick Young, c.1616 (49.12); Peiresc for 
              Fronton du Duc, 1621 (2.60); Thomas Howard, by 1631 
              (113.13: presumably the same loan as is noted against 
              the entries for the manuscript in 6018, fol. 111, and in 
              36682). 
            Loan 2.60 was the subject of much correspondence: see 
              Smith, Camden's Correspondence, 261, 267, 269, 282, 
              291, 294, 309, 321, 326; Bodl., MSS  Smith 25 (SC 
              15632), p. 33, Smith 79 (SC 15685), p. 29; Harl. MS 
              7002, fol. 446; Jul. C.III, fol. 291. See also du Duc’s 
              assessment of the manuscript: Smith, Catalogue, ‘History 
              and Synopsis’ p. 57. His borrowing ran from March 
              1618 to February 1622: Weitzmann & Kessler, p. 3. 
           In consequence  of the loan to Howard, the manuscript 
             was long absent from the Cotton library. Latterly in the 
             hands  of William Howard, Viscount Stafford, Thomas 
             Howard's  second son, it was bought back by Sir John 
             Cotton from William  Howard's widow, Mary  (who, in 
             the course of negotiation in 1684, wrongly claimed that 
             it had never been owned by the Cotton library but had 
             been lent by Thomas  Howard,  earl of Arundel, to Sir 
             Thomas   Cotton  who  had  then had  it bound  and 
             adorned  with his coat of arms): Smith, Catalogue, ‘To

      print the Genesis. See also Weitzmann & Kessler and
