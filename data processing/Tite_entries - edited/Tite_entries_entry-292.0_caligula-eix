*  CALIGULA      E.IX   Records  and  papers  concerning 
           England and  France, 1593-1600. 
         Catalogues: 35213, fol. 40v (? this); 36789, fols 5-5v; 
           36682 (no entries in the catalogue but recorded as pre- 
           sent in the 1656/7 checklist, fol. 1). 
         Loan: Thomas  Wilson, c.1613 (35.1: ? parts of this, Calig. 
           EVIII and X). 
         Part I: annotations by William Cecil, passim; fol. 283v, 
          art. 81, is noted ‘In the booke Chest in mr secretary 
           Cecill study:’. 
         Part II: fols 3-42y, art. 85, is one of the items offered for 
           sale to Cotton, listed in Calig. E.XII, fol. 133v, and is 
          almost certainly in the same hand as the E.XII entry: if 
           so, Planta, Catalogue, is wrong in stating that art. 85 
           is an original document. Fol. 49v (a list of two docu- 
           ments  not catalogued  by  Planta but following  his 
           art. 88) is noted ‘In the booke Chest in mr secretary


Cecill study:’; fols 91-96, art. 98, was copied for Cotton 
     from  an  original lent to him by  Anthony  Mildmay

(fol. 91).
