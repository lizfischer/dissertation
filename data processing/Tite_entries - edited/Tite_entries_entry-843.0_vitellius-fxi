?* VITELLIUS    F.XI Psalter; ete. 
     Catalogues: 6018, no. 309; 36789, fol. 61; 36682. 
     Used  by James Ussher: A. O'Sullivan, â€˜The colophon of 
       the  Cotton Psalter (Vitellius F.XI), Journal of the 
       Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, 96, part 2 (1966), 179. 
     According to 6018 and 36682, the manuscript once con- 
       tained, at the beginning, a charter of King Offa. This is 
       not, however,  mentioned   in 36789   or in  Smith, 
       Catalogue. See also Bodl., MS Dugdale 48 (SC 6536), 
       fol. 28v, a reference I owe to Simon Keynes who kindly 
       drew my  attention to the charter.
