CLAUDIUS      B.VIII Samaritan Pentateuch. 
  The  former Claud. B.VIII, collections relating to Chancery, 
     is now Add. MS 46410, and is so entered. 
  Catalogue: 36682  (the first entry for the manuscript, as 
    Tib. A.l, has been deleted and another manuscript, a 
     copy of the Koran, there substituted. The Pentateuch 
    was  then entered, by Thomas Cotton, as Claud. B.VIII. 
    These  alterations may  be explained  by an  obscure 
     episode in 1641 when Jacques Dary du Perron, bishop 
     of Angoul√©me and Almoner  to Queen Henrietta Maria, 
     offered the Pentateuch as a gift to Cardinal Richelieu: 
     HMC  9th Report, Appendix  part II, 408.).
