?* VITELLIUS E.IX Chronicles; ete. 
 Catalogues: 35213, fol. 37, no. 25; 6018, no. 14; 36789, fol. 
 61 (artt. 1 and 2 only); 36682 (artt. 1 and 2 only). 
 Previous ownership: (of fols 1-70, art. 1) ? Henry Savile 
 (Watson, Savile of Banke, unidentified no. 221a. Savile's 
 entry is of a chronicle running from Richard I to Henry 
 V, whereas the chronicle in F.IX finishes in 1439. Never- 
 theless, the contents of the article correspond to Savile’s 
 description (‘Chronicon de London, de nominibus 
 majorum praetorum, et Vicecomitum...), but the 
 second item in Savile's entry (no. 221b) is no longer in 
 the volume). 
 Previous ownership: (of fols 71-251, artt. 2-4) ? John 
 Parker (Strongman, John Parker’s manuscripts’, 17, no. 
 47. Strongman’s identification seems very probable, 
 although A.F. Vossen had previously suggested that 
 these articles were transcribed for Cotton, c.1600: Two 
 Bokes of the Histories of Ireland (Assen, 1963), pp. 93, 96.) 
 Loans: William Camden, 1606 (10.19); Richard Bancroft, 
 1608, by hand of Zachariah Pasfeild (29.17); James

Ussher, c.1610-12 (41.6); John Selden, 1641 (223.2: ? 
 this or ? Vit. FXII).
