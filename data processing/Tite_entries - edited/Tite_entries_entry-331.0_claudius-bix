  Catalogues: 6018, no. 262; 36789, fol. 121v; 36682. 
  Previous ownership:  (of fols 2-263, art. 1) ? John Dee, 
     Nicholas Saunder (Roberts &  Watson, Dee, M92,  pp. 
     50-52; Jul. C.IH, fol. 334). 
   Loan: Patrick Young, 1621-22 (2.115). 
   Extracts by Richard James are in Bodl., MS James 10 (SC 
     3847), p. 183. 
   In what appears to be a checklist of manuscripts in 6018, 
     fol. 146, the entry ‘262 Julius A.2’ uses the inventory 
     number  of this manuscript. 
  This volume  helps in dating progress in compiling 6018: 
     Saunder’s letter in Jul. C.III, fol. 334, offering Cotton 
     what must  surely be this copy of the Helinandus, is 
     dated 30 November, 1621 (Roberts & Watson, Dee, M92 
     and plate VIa), and Cotton had added the remaining 
     articles to the manuscript before it was entered in 6018. 
  Annexes  3a, 7b.
