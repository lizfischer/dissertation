GALBA    E.XIV Compotus of John of Newbury, 1359. 
    Catalogues: no entries. 
    Nigel Ramsay (BL, Department of Manuscripts records) 
      suggests that the manuscript presumably entered the 
      Cotton library between 1718 (since it is not in Add. MS 
      4696, the inventory made in that year) and 1731 (since 
      it was damaged in the Ashburnham House fire).
