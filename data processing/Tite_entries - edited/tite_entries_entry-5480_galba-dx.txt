         Previous ownership:  Some  of the papers in this volume 
           addressed  to Thomas Bodley are originals: this suggests 
           that Bodley may  himself have passed these to Cotton. 
         Papers in this volume may be among  those sent to Cotton 
           by Ralph  Starkey, possibly in 1625: Jul. C.III, fol. 362. 
         Fol. 93, art. 44, fols 108-9y, art. 47, fols 122â€”22v, art. 53, 
           etc., are in the hand of a scribe who worked for Cotton.
