* NERO   DVI  Anglo-French  treaties; Modus tenendi par-

     Catalogues: 6018, no. 195; 36789, fols 33v-34; 36682. 
     Previous ownership:  (of fols 2-92, artt. 1-17) Gilbert 
       Dethick who  gave the manuscript in 1586 to his son, 
       William, who in turn gave it to Cotton on 25 July, 1608 
       (fols 1v, 92; 36.15, 58.3, 60.2, 68.2). 
     The suggestion by Jayne &  Johnson  that artt. 1a, 2-17, 
       belonged to Lord Lumley  (Lumley Library, nos 1489, 
       1490; the first part of their no. 1490a is also seemingly 
       a description of this manuscript) conflicts with the 
       ownership record set out in the manuscript itself (see 
       above). The problem  is only likely to be resolved if 
       a close copy of DVI, to fit the Lumley entry, can be 
       identified: although Vit. C.IV contains some of the 
       same material, taken as a whole it hardly answers to the 
       description. 
    Loans:  Daniel  Dunn,  by  1611 (55.3: ? this); George 
       Allington, by 1611 (58.3, 60.2); Roger Owen, 1611 + 
      (68.2); Robert  Bowyer, ¢.1613 (36.15); John Selden, 
      ¢.1638 (163.5: ? this or ? Vit. C.IV); William Le Neve, 
       1641 (213.1: ? this, ? Vit. C.IV or ? Vesp. C.XIV); King 
      Charles II, 1660, by hand of John Ball (fol. 1v). 
    It is likely that the request of Richard Connock in 1609 for 
      material dealing with the  grant of Aquitaine to the

Black  Prince relates to either fols 31-34y, art. 3, of this 
           manuscript   or part of fols 1-51, art. 1, in Vit. C.IV: Jul. 
           C.II,  fol. 106.
