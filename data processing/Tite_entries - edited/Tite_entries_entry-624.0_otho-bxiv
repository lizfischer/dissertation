        Catalogues: 6018, no. 225; 36682.

Fol. 5, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus’ 
   Previous ownership:  (of fols 206-35, art. 3, + ? fols 
     236-58, art. 4) William Sayley (fol. 205). 
   Loans: Arthur Agarde, 1612-15 (18.17: this, Vesp. AXVIII 
     or E.ID); Agarde, 1612-15 (71.2, 77.5, not necessarily a 
     duplicate of loan 18.17); Richard St George, by 1614 
     (15.4: this or Calig. A-XII or XIII); ‘Mr Morgan’, 1616 
     (109.2); Humphrey  Henchman,  ? 1624 (2.102, cf. 6018, 
     no. 225);  Samuel  Roper,  senior, 1638  (171.1); (1) 
     Samuel, senior, or (2) Thomas Roper, 1639 (182.1. This 
     loan may  well have  been  the occasion, in January 
     1638/9, when  Roger  Dodsworth  made  extracts from 
     Henry  of Huntingdon’s Historia Anglorum, which  he 
     then recorded as in Samuel Roper’s hands: fols 236-58, 
     art. 4, of B.XIV includes excerpts from  Henry. See 
     Bodl., MS Dodsworth  41 (SC 4183), fols 74~75v.); Percy 
     Herbert, Lord Powys, by the hand of Knasbrough  and 
     Vaughan, 1661/2 (267.2). 
   Thomas  Talbot made extracts from B.XIV, fols 162, 166, 
     169v, etc., art. 2, which are now in Faust. E. II, fols 
     216-20v.

Extracts in BL, Stowe MS 528, fols 249v-50, are taken 
     from fols 166v and 163, art. 2 (Pipewell), of BXTV, and 
     the original is noted as in Cotton's hands. 
   This manuscript  was missing from  the Cotton  library 
     before Thomas  Smith drew  up his Catalogue of 1696. 
     He therefore entered another volume under B.XIV, the 
     Lenton cartulary: this had been owned  by Scipio Le 
     Squyer (Ovenden,  ‘Scipio Le Squyer’, 325 and n. 14), 
     was given to the library by Samuel Roper, junior, of 
     Heanor in the 1670s, probably as early as 1670 (the date 
     of his gift of Claud. A.XIII and Nero E.VII ), and was 
     destroyed in the fire of 1731. The Sheen-Pipewell Otho 
     was bought by the British Museum in 1787 and restored 
     to its previous pressmark. See Davis, MC,  no. 551. 
     Planta’s suggestion (Catalogue) that it may once have 
     been Otho B.1 is incorrect: ef. the catalogue entries in 
     36682, and Bodl., MS Dodsworth  78 (SC 5019), fol. 41, 
     extracts probably made in 1639. (Other extracts are in 
     MS  Dodsworth   108  (SC  5049), fol. 39, and  MS 
     Dodsworth  136 (SC 5077), fol. 49.)
