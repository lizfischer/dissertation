TIBERIUS EV    Cartulary   of  St  James’s   Abbey, 
      Northampton. 
    Catalogues: 6018, no. 202; 36682. 
    Previous ownership: ‘Mr Somersett the Harold’ (according 
      to Robert Beale: Add. MS 32100, fol. 208), presumably 
      Robert Glover. The manuscript  was used by Beale: his 
      initials are on fols 20v, 24, 26v and 44. 
    Previous ownership: ‘Fran. Tate’ (fol. 212v, and possibly 
      again on  fol. 213v). Davis, MC, no. 698 assigns the 
      manuscript  to Francis Tate’s ownership, dating this to 
      1591 apparently on the strength of the appearance of 
      this date in a section of index on fol. 213. However, it is 
      not certain that the entry on fol. 213 is in Tate’s hand. 
    Loan: Christopher Hatton, 1639 (167.1). 
    Robert Rich asked Cotton to permit his agent to examine 
      this manuscript, 1621 (Jul. C.III, fol. 131). 
    This is the manuscript consulted by John Selden when he 
      wrote his address to Augustine Vincent in Discoverie of 
      Errours, sig. a2y. I owe this reference to Gerald Toomer. 
      Although  Selden’s extract from fol. 222 has not been 
      found in the (badly damaged)   manuscript, the tran- 
      script of this folio in Bodl., MS Top. Northants C.5 (SC 
      16622), p. 474, leaves no room for doubt that E.V was 
      Selden’s source. The transcript also indicates that he 
      used the manuscript  in his Titles of Honour: Gerald 
      ‘Toomer has informed  me  that this must refer to the 
      second edition of that work (in which there is an exten- 
      sive extract from the E.V cartulary on pp. 731ff) but that 
      much  of that edition was prepared (and perhaps set in 
      type) in the early 1620s. 
   A  transcript taken  from  this manuscript,  by  Roger 
      Dodsworth, of the foundation charter of the abbey is in 
      Bodl., MS Dodsworth  61 (SC 5003), fol. 120. Extracts, 
      made  in 1638 by William  Dugdale, are in Bodl,, MS 
      Dugdale 15 (SC 6505), p. 30.
