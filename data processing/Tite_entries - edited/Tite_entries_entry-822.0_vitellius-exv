VITELLIUS     E.XV  Cartulary of Osney Abbey; etc. 
     Catalogues: 6018, no. 282; 36682. 
     Previous ownership: Augustine Steward, 1596; ‘Mr Geffe’, 
       1599; John Stow  (Bodl, MS  Dodsworth  39 (SC 4181), 
       fols 95v, 97v; BL, Stowe MS 1047, fol. 105; Cartulary of 
       Oseney Abbey,  ed. by H.E. Salter (Oxford Historical 
       Society, 89, etc., 1929-36), I, pp. ix-x, Addenda and 
       Corrigenda following p. xxviii). 
     Loans: Lawrence  Tanfield, 1621 (2.37, 4.25); ‘Mr Taylor’, 
       after 1621 and probably not earlier than 1625 (80.3); 
       John Doyly, 1637 or 1638 (170.1). 
     This or the later version of the cartulary, Oxford, Christ 
       Church, Chapter  Library MS,  D&C  vi.a.1 (see entry), 
       must be the manuscript that Richard Montague  asked 
       Cotton to lend him: Jul. C.IT, fol. 276 (undated letter, 
       possibly c.1617).

This  or the Christ Church  manuscript  used  by John 
          Selden  and listed (‘Chartular[y] ... of the Abbey of 
          Osney’) as a Cotton manuscript in his Historie of Tithes, 
          1618. Despite Selden’s fairly extensive refereffces (on 
          pp. 306-8, 357, 397-402), they do not appear to reflect 
          sufficiently precisely the content and order in either 
          manuscript  to make it possible to determine which of 
          the two was  his source. It is, in fact, not impossible 
          that he used both, as both were probably in Cotton's 
          possession when Selden was preparing his book. 
        Transcripts from this manuscript, made by Arthur Agarde 
          in 1596 (as recorded in Dodsworth  39, fol. 97v, when 
          E.XV was  in Steward’s possession), may be the item lent 
          (and  possibly lost) at 44.6. Other extracts, probably 
          made  in 1639, are  in Bodl., MS Dodsworth   78 (SC 
          5019), fol. 117v.
