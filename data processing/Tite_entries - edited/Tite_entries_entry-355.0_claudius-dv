CLAUDIUS     DV 
            Catalogue: there is a side-heading for the pressmark of 
              this manuscript in 36682  but no description; in the 
              checklist of 1656/7 it is recorded as ‘... wanting: as 
              appeareth alsoe by a paper over the place’, and it is 
              entered in no other catalogue. It is probable that Claud. 
              DV  was one  and the same manuscript as Nero  C.VII 
              which carries the D.V pressmark, in Richard James’s 
              hand, on fol. 1.
