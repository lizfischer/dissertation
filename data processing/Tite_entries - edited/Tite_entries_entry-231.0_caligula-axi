?*  CALIGULA A.XI  Robert  of Gloucester, historical 
     poem; Piers Plowman; etc. 
   Catalogues: 6018, no. 25; 36789, fol. 138; 36682 (entry 
     marked ‘wanting’). 
   Previous ownership: (of at least art. 1, fols 3-168yv) ? John 
     Stow. (In his Remaines William Camden used a copy of 
     Robert of Gloucester’s work ‘in the Librarie of the 
     industrious Antiquary maister John  Stowe’ and the 
     additions on fol. 164v of A.XI are in Stow’s hand; but 
   there is also a transcript of Robert by Stow in the archives 
     of the Merchant Taylor's Company: see Remaines of a 
     Greater Worke, concerning Britaine, ed. by R.D. Dunn 
     (Toronto, 1984), p. 94, a reference I owe to Gerald 
     Toomer.) 
  Art. 1, fols 3-168v, used by John Selden and listed (‘Robert 
    of Glocester’) as a Cotton manuscript in his Historie of 
     Tithes, 1618. There are annotations by Selden through- 
     out the article and (on fols 3, 18v, 20, 74v, 83 and 85v) 
     cross-references to Thomas Allen’s manuscript of the 
     same text (now Bodl., MS Digby 205 (SC 1806)) which
he was also using (and from which he inserted extracts 
                  into A.XI on fols 75 and 81). On p. 206 of the Historie 
                  of Tithes the extract he prints from the text (‘In Bibl. 
                  Cotton. &  apud V.C. Tho. Allen. Oxon.)  is probably 
                  taken  from  the Allen  manuscript: the  wording  is 
                  similar to, but not identical with, that on fol. 80 of AXI 
                  (nevertheless annotated by him “Tithad [sic]’). Other 
                  detailed cross-references noted by him in the margins 
                  of A.X1 link up with further sources which he made use 
                  of in the Historie, pp. 204-10. 
                Extracts by Richard James are in Bodl., MS James 18 (SC 
                  3855), p. 69. Further extracts, marked as from  this 
                  manuscript, are in James Ware's notebook, Bodl., MS 
                  Rawlinson B.479 (SC 11826), fol. 78v.
