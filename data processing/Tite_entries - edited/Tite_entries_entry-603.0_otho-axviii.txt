?* OTHO   A.XVIII Lives of the Fathers; constitutions of the 
             Carthusian order; etc. 
           Catalogues: 36789, fols 115-16v; 36682 (where numbered 
             AXVII). 
           It has been suggested that the Chaucer material once in 
             A.XVIII  (Smith artt. 24-28) may  have belonged to 
             John  Shirley (d. 1456): A. Brusendorff, The Chaucer 
              Tradition (London and Copenhagen, 1925), p. 229, but 
              see G.B. Pace, ‘Otho A.XVIII’, Speculum, 26 (1951), 
              306-16. 
            There are two entries for A-XVIII in Smith's Catalogue 
              but the first, on p. 68, is a printer's error for A-XVII. The 
              omission of Otho A.XV from  36682 accounts for the 
              discrepancy between its numbering of this manuscript 
              and that of the correct A-XVIII in Smith’s Catalogue.
