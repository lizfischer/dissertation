PETERBOROUGH,        DEAN   AND  CHAPTER,     MS 1 
      (now at CUL) ‘Liber R. de Swafham’. 
    Previous owner (or agent in handling the manuscript): 
      John Lambe (47.4: ? this). 
    Loans: Lambe, by 1612 (26.1: ? this); Arthur Agarde, 
      1612-15 (18.2: ? this); Lambe and Henry Hickman,

1612-15 (47.4: ? this). To call Lambe a borrower may be 
          incorrect (see 47.4 where he clearly has control of the 
          manuscript  there entered). If, as I believe, Cotton did 
          not hold the manuscript after making the loan at 47.4, 
          that to Agarde must pre-date it.
