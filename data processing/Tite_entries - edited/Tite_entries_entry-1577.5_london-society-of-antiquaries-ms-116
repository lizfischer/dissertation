               116 Collections dealing with coinage. 
             Catalogue: 36789, fol. 13v (? this and / or ? Otho E.X). 
             Fol. 61, ‘Ro: Cotton’; fol. 150, ‘Ro: Cotton’; fol. 159, 
               ‘Robertus Cotton’. 
             Loan: Henry  Montagu,  1621 (2.25: ? this). 
             Possibly among the manuscripts that Robert Sidney asked 
               to borrow in 1623 and which Cotton had previously told 
               him  were on  loan to the Lord President (perhaps an 
               error for the Lord Treasurer, the borrower at 2.25): Jul. 
               C.II, fol. 364. 
             The  endorsement   on fol. 152v, art. 8, is probably by 
               William  Cecil. The annotation on fol. 158v, art. 10, and 
               the additions to the text on fol. 323, art. 29, are by 
               Henry  Howard.  Fols 132, 140-41y, part of art. 6, fols 
               245-47v, art. 18, fol. 316, art. 26, fols 332-36, art. 34, 
               are in the hand of Ralph Starkey. 
             This volume  has many   organizational notes by Cotton, 
               together with his binding instructions (on fol. 338v). 
             Annexes  7b, 8e. 
             I am grateful to the Librarian of the Society of Antiquaries 
               for permitting me to examine this volume.
