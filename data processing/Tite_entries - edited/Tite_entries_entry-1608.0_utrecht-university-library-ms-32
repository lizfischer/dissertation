* UTRECHT,       UNIVERSITY       LIBRARY,     MS   32 
          Utrecht Psalter. 
        Formerly Claud. C.VII. 
        Catalogue: 6018, no. 207. The entry in the 1656/7 check- 
          list (36682, fol. 1) reads: ‘C.7. not in the Catalogue. A 
          booke there, in the place. But found by the Contents, 
          and marke, or inscription; to be B.7. Quod Mathildis, 
          etc. wrongly supposed before, because out of his place, 
          to be wanting. Soe that C.7. (as appeares alsoe by the 
          paper over the place) is still wanting’. 
        Previous ownership: ? Thomas  Howard, Aletheia Talbot 
          or Mary Talbot. The possible identity of Mary Talbot 
          (whose signature or name is on fol. 57v) has been the

subject of much  discussion: see particularly K. van 
    der  Horst  and  J.H.A. Engelbregt,  Utrecht-Psalter. 
    Vollstandige Faksimile-Ausgabe im Originalformat der 
    Handschrift  32 aus  dem  Besitz der Bibliotheek der 
    Rijksuniversiteit te Utrecht: Kommentar (Graz, 1984), 
    pp. 57, 61, and most recently The Utrecht Psalter in 
    Medieval Art, ed. by K. van der Horst, W. Noel and 
    W.C.M.  Wiistefeld (MS't Goy, 1996), p. 35 n. 64. For 
    several related reasons, the Mary Talbot who was the 
    sister of Aletheia Talbot, countess of Arundel, would 
    appear to be the most probable of the candidates. Mary 
    was mentally handicapped (which could account for the 
    crudeness of the annotation) and if her association with 
    the manuscript is correct it would seem more likely to 
    have belonged to her sister or brother-in-law than to 
    her (perhaps to be annotated by her during a visit to 
    them). The  close associations between the Arundels 
    and  Cotton could  then explain the transfer of the 
   manuscript to him and his readiness to return it to the 
    earl (with a number of other outstanding manuscripts) 
    on an extended loan. 
  Loan: Thomas  Howard,  earl of Arundel, by 1631 (113.14). 
    See also loan 271. The loan to Howard was almost cer- 
    tainly the occasion of the manuscript’s loss from the 
    Cotton library. See Van der Horst and Engelbregt, pp. 
    57-61, Van der Horst, Noel and Wiistefeld, pp. 33-35, 
    and Tite, ‘Lost or stolen or strayed’, pp. 271-72. 
  Used by James  Ussher: see T.D. Hardy, The Athanasian 
    Creed in connexion with the Utrecht Psalter (London, 
    1872), pp. 7-8, quoting from Ussher’s De symbolis. 
  Van der Horst, Noel and Wiistefeld, pp. 32-33, argue that 
    the gospel leaves at the end of the manuscript were 
    bound  in by Cotton. The charter, once bound with the 
    manuscript  and   now  Aug.  II.2, was  presumably 
    removed  from it by Cotton.

  1am  most grateful to Dr van der Horst for permitting me 
    to examine the Utrecht Psalter.
