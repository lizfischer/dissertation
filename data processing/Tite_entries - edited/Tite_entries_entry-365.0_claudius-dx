?* CLAUDIUS      D.X Chronicle; cartulary (the ‘Red Book’) 
           of St Augustine’s Abbey, Canterbury. 
         Catalogues: 6018, no. 266; 36682. 
         Previous ownership: (of fols 9-319, art. 2) John Twyne, 
           father and son, and ‘Mr Wilford’ (fols 9, 123v; Harl. MS 
           1879, fol. 19v). Extracts, presumably from this manu- 
           script, in Bodl., MS Twyne 22, fol. 246v, carry a note by 
           Brian Twyne  in the margin: ‘Mr Rich: James of CCC. 
           Oxon  .... If, as seems likely, this reflects a loan by 
           Twyne to his friend, Richard James, the latter was no 
           doubt the means by which the Cotton library acquired

these folios. 
         Loans:  Augustine Vincent, before or in 1621 (Vesp. F.XIII, 
            no. 316: this, Jul. D.II, Vit. A.II or D.X); John Borough, 
            1621 (2.77; cf. Jul. C.IH, fols 79, 80).
