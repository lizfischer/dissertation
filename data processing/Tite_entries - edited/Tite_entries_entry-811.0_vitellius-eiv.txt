?* VITELLIUS     E.IV Chronicles; etc. 
  Catalogues: 6018, no. 173; 36789, fols 31v-32v; 36682. 
  Previous ownership:  (of Smith art. 7, destroyed, of this) 
    Walter  Cope (Watson,  ‘Cope’, p. 289, no. 186: ‘Sprott 
    Tho.  Chronica’, suggests that Tib. A.IX, fols 107-80, 
    Vit. D.X1I, fols 39-69, or London, Lambeth Palace, MS 
     419 - but not this - may have  been the manuscript 
    owned  by Cope. However, each of the catalogues, above, 
    lists Sprott as author of art. 7 of this.). 
  Loan:  Richard  Bancroft, 1608, by hand  of Zachariah 
     Pasfeild (29.20: this, Tib. A.IX or Vit. D-X1). 
  It is likely that the manuscript used by John Selden and 
    listed (‘Thomas Sprot, a Monk  of Canterburie’) as a 
     Cotton manuscript in his Historie of Tithes, 1618, was 
    Tib. A.IX  rather than  the destroyed art. 7 of this 
     manuscript. His extracts on pp. 321-22, 397 are to be 
    found  in A.IX  where the  passages cited are among 
    those underlined in ink. Moreover, A.[X was certainly 
    lent to him, albeit at a later date. It should, neverthe- 
    less, be noted that Vit. E.IV, art. 7, apparently covered 
    the same  years as those from which Selden’s extracts 
    were  taken. 
  (1) This or CUL, Add. MS  3578, or (2) Tib. A.IX or Vit. 
     D.XI may be the manuscript Simonds  D’Ewes asked to 
    borrow  in 1626 (82.27). 
  Extracts by Richard James  in Bodl., MS James  10 (SC 
    3847), p. 142, may have been taken from this, Vit. D.XI 
    (not D.X, as SC suggests) or CUL, Add. MS 3578. 
  Fols 1-18v, Smith art. 8, was catalogued by Planta as art. 
     1 of Appx XLV: see the BL’s ‘Unrevised Descriptions’ of 
    the Cotton Appendix  volumes.
