OXFORD,      BODLEIAN       LIBRARY,     MS   DODS- 
          WORTH      20  (SC  4162), Part  A. Formerly  Jul. 
          B.X. William Camden, genealogical collections; ete. 
        Catalogue: 36682 (but listed as wanting in the checklist 
          of 1656/7, fol. 1). 
        The   manuscript  is entered as  missing  in Smith's 
          Catalogue, but in his annotated copy he has noted: 
          ‘Enquire whether my Lord  Hatton hath not this book 
          :- +: Bodl., MS Smith 140 (SC 15738). As the last of 
          Roger  Dodsworth’s  manuscripts  had  reached  the 
          Bodleian  in 1683-84,  well before Thomas   Smith 
          became  librarian to John Cotton, he must have been 
          relying on old information in recording this possibility, 
          although the evidence of Hatton ownership of parts of 
          MS  Dodsworth  76 (see entry) may add strength to it. 
          Smith’s ‘Lord Hatton’ must be the second baron who 
          succeeded his father to the title in 1670. 
        Fols 78-79, but not the other folios listed in SC, are in the 
          hand  of Thomas Talbot.

Extracts by Dodsworth   from the manuscript  (which he 
     cites as ‘Julius B.10. in bibliotheca Cottoniana’) are in 
     Bodl., MS Dodsworth  108 (SC 5049), fol. 88. 
  The  volume contains material assembled by Camden  and 
     published in his Remaines of a Greater Worke, concern- 
     ing Britaine (1605): see p. xxviii of R.D. Dunn’s edition 
     (Toronto, 1984).
