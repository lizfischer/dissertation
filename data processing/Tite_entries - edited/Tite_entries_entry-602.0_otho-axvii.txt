OTHO   A.XVII  Register of Peterborough Abbey, ete. 
           Catalogues: 35213, fol. 43v; 6018, no. 65; 36682 (where 
             numbered  A.XVI). 
           Loans: John Lambe, ? by 1612 (26.2: this, Vesp. A-XXIV, 
             Cleo. C.l, II or Faust. B.III); Arthur Agarde, 1612 
             (77.13: this or Faust. B.II1); Agarde, 1612-15 (71.15: ? 
             this); John Bernard, 1658 (233.2). 
           Martin’s suggestion (Cartularies of Peterborough Abbey, 
             pp. 34-35) that artt. 2 and 3 were at one time separate 
             (as Otho A.XVI) in the Cotton library from the remain- 
             der of A.XVII  is unsustainable: the contents of the 
             manuscript  are unchanged  from  the entry in 6018, 
             through that in 36682 (where the foliation is set out), 
             to that in Smith’s Catalogue The confusion over press- 
             mark numbering,  to which her analysis draws attention 
             (and on which it is, in part, based), has another origin. 
             A.XVII was  numbered  A-XVI in 36682 (because of the 
             omission there of A-XV), A-XVII in the Fire Report, and 
             A.XVIII  in Smith's Catalogue, p. 68 (because of a print- 
             ing error). Subsequent citations to it therefore vary, 
             depending  upon the catalogue used. As the manuscript 
            itself was destroyed in the fire of 1731 there is no certain 
             means  of knowing which  pressmark was written in it 
             but the evidence of loan 233.2 favours A-XVI.
