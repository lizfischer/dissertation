GALBA  EVII Eulogium Historiarum; ete. 

               Catalogues: 36789, fol. 154v; 36682  (no entry in the 
                 catalogue but recorded as present in the 1656/7 check- 
                 list on fol. 1v). The entry in 6018, at no. 163, has long 
                 been identified as Galba E.VII but the first item listed 
                 there, John de Rupescissa’s Vade mecum   in tribula- 
                 tione, is not in E.VII. It is, however, the opening item of 
                 Dublin, Trinity College, MS 497 (E.2.26). My reference 
                 to E.VII in ‘Lost or stolen or strayed’, p. 270, requires 
                 amendment   in the light of the above evidence. The 
                 entry for the Eulogium in Add. MS 35213, fol. 43v, also 
                 lists John de Rupescissa’s work and is therefore of TCD 
                 MS  497 rather than of Galba EVI; while the entry in 
                 36789  (noting that the supplement to the Eulogium 
               takes  it down to the beginning of Henry V’s reign) is 
                 clearly of E.VII.

     The  annotation on fol. 191 of E.VII (Hucusque  codex 
       Archiepiscopi Armachani’)  is by Richard James  and 
       refers to the termination point of MS 497.
