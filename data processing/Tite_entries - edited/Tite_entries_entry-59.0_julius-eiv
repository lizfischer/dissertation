* JULIUS E.IV Thomas Elmham, life of Henry V; pageant 
 of Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick; etc. 
 Catalogues: 6018, no. 348; 36682. 
 Previous ownership: (of fols 2-9, art. 1) John Selden 
 (fol. 2). 
 Previous ownership: (of fols 10-87, art. 2) ‘Rob. Cotton. 
 Bruceus ex dono Walter Cop militis 1603’ (fol. 10; 
 Watson, ‘Cope’, 292, no. 3). Watson, “Twyne’, 151, sug- 
 gests that this (among other possibilities) may be the 
 Elmham manuscript said by Holinshed to have been 
 owned by John Twyne (d. 1581). 
 Previous ownership: (of fols 89-112, art. 3) ? Prince Henry 
 and / or Royal library, if (1) this or (2) Vesp. D.XIII or 
 Cleo. C.IV is the manuscript listed by Cotton as one of 
 the ‘Books I want’, c.1609-12 (130.13). 
 Previous ownership: (of fols 113-27, art. 4) ‘Ex dono 
 Patricii Young’ (fol. 113). 
 Previous ownership: (of fols 128-93, art. 5) ‘Ro: Cotton: 
 ex dono Willimi Dethick militis Garter 161< >’ (by ultra- 
 violet light). 
 Previous ownership: (separately bound and foliated, art. 6) 
 Robert Glover (ef. item X 1 in the list of his books in BL, 
 Lansdowne MS 58, fol. 105v. I am grateful to Nigel 
 Ramsay for this identification. 
 Name: ‘Mr Wandisford of Lincolns Inn esquier’, ‘Michaell 
 Wandisford esquier’ (fol. 127v). 
 Both George Carew (d. 1629) and John Speed asked for 
 Cotton’s assistance in their search for evidence relating 
 to the life of Henry V (see Jul. C.III, fols 68, 357). In 
 Speed's case, this was for his Historie of Great Britaine 
 (London, 1611), and on p. 645 he gives a detailed 
 account of the participants in Queen Katherine's coro- 
 nation in 1421, stating that this information derives 
 from a Cotton manuscript. Jul E.IV would seem to be


his most likely source but neither this nor any other 
 similarly related Cottonian manuscript appears now to 
 contain the details Speed printed. 
 According to F. Taylor & J. S. Roskell (Gesta Henrici 
 Quinti. The deeds of Henry V (Oxford 1975), p. xvi), 
 fols 89-112 were once part of Tib. B.XII. The date of 
 separation is unknown but if these folios are those at 
 130.13 it is unlikely that Cotton was responsible for the 
 division. (Note: My reading of the dates of gifts from 
 Cope and Dethick differs slightly from that given by 
 Taylor & Roskell, p. xvi.)
