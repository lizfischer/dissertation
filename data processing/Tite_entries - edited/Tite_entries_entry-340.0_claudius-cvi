* CLAUDIUS     CVI  Burchard, bishop of Worms, collection 
      of canon laws; ete. 
    Catalogues: 6018, no. 315; 36682. 
    Previous ownership: (of fols 1-169, artt. 1-5) Henry Savile 
       (Watson, Savile of Banke, no. 11). 
    Although fols 170-203, artt. 6-10, were once part of Royal 
       MS  7 EVI (see Ker, MLGB, p. 35) and although it has 
      been  suggested (by Jayne & Johnson, Lumley Library, 
       no. 629) that Nero C.IX, fols 19-21y, art. 2, may once 
      have been flyleaves of 7 E.VI, it is unlikely that Cotton 
      was  responsible for separating these sections of C.VI 
      from  the Royal manuscript: there is no mention of the 
      Claud. articles in the entry identified as Royal 7. E.VI in 
      the  Lumley  catalogue and  there is no evidence of 
      Cotton's hand in the Royal manuscript. 
    Fols 1 and 205 (flyleaves) once belonged with fols 157-64 
      of  Vit. C.VII  (see note  by Frederic  Madden   on 
      CII,    fol. 157). It is not known whether Cotton was 
      responsible for this separation.
