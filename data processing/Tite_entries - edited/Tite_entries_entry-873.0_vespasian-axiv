Fols 1, 114, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus’. 
     Previous ownership: (of fols 1-105, artt. 1-4) John Prise 
       (annotations on fol. 42v, 60, etc: Ker, ‘Prise’, 16, 22); 
       Henry   Sidney  (cbid.); Matthew  Parker  (red chalk 
       pagination). The  annotation on  fol. 6 is by Jaspar 
       Gryffyth who  refers to this material in his annotated 
       copy (now in the National Library of Scotland) of John 
       Bale, Illustrium maioris Britanniae scriptorum. (I owe 
       this reference to Richard Ovenden. See also Ovenden’s 
       Jaspar  Gryffyth  and  his  books’, British Library 
       Journal, 20 (1994), 129, no. 23, 132, no. 3, 133, no. 10.), 
       Fols 106-13, artt. 5-8, were possibly combined with this 
       section when Cotton received it. 
     Fols 114-71, artt. 9-16, are annotated by John Joscelyn 
       and  were possibly combined   with fols 172-79, artt. 
       17-22, when Cotton received them. 
     Loans: (of fols 1-105, artt. 1-4, + ? fols 106-13, artt. 5-8) 
       Francis Tate, by 1612, and William Camden (22.3); (of 
       at least fols 1-105, artt. 1-4, and fols 114~71, artt. 9-16) 
       Patrick Young, c.1616 (49.11); Henry  Spelman,  1617 
       (99.2: (1) this or (2) Vit. CX); James Ussher, 1621 (2.4; 
       loan noted against entry in 6018); Christopher Hatton, 
       1639 (165: this or Tib. A.XV); Ussher, 1640 (199.1: (1) 
       this or (2) Tib. A.XV).  With  the exception of fols 
       106-13, artt. 5-8, the manuscript carries annotations 
       by Ussher. 
    Artt. 4, 11 and 19 used or mentioned by John Selden and 
       listed (‘The storie of the Church of Landaff... and a 
       Councell of the yeer 816 ... and some Decrees of Odo 
       Archbishop of Canterburie are bound up with it . And 
       in the same Volume  the life of S. Cadoc’) as a Cotton 
       manuscript in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. Selden thus 
       makes  it clear that these articles were then bound 
       together. His extract on p. 250  (‘The storie of the 
       Church of Landaff  . . :), also cited in his list of refer- 
       ences as from the ‘Cartular[y] ... of the Church  of 
      Landaff,  or Tilo .. 2, is from fol. 36v, art. 4, of AXXTV 
      (the ‘Anonym. Ms. de primo statu Landauens. Ecclesiae 
       ..-) and from Vit. C.X, fol. 38v, art. 4. His further 
      extracts are taken from A.XTV as follows: on his pp. 261 
      and  277 (the ‘Councell’) respectively from fols 149v and 
       152v-53, and from fols 149 and 152y, art. 11; on his pp. 
      217  and  218 (‘Decrees of Odo’) from  fols 175v and 
      177-777, art. 9; and on his p. 276 (‘Cadoc’) from fol. 38, 
     art.  4. In his marginal note to the extract on p. 250 
      Selden also gives a third, though non-Cottonian, source 
      (‘in Codice Landau.)  for his citation. This must be a 
      reference to the Book  of Llandaff, now Aberystwyth, 
      National  Library of Wales MS  17110E, which  Selden 
      later borrowed from Theophilus  Field: see Davis, MC, 
      no. 594.
