TIBERIUS CVI  Psalter; ete. 
              Catalogues: 35213, fol. 37, no. 28 (? this), fol. 43v (two 
                 entries: this, Vit. E-XVIII or Vesp. A.1); 36789, fol. 157, 
                 no. 32 (? this); 36682. 
              Fol. 2, ‘Thomas Cotton’. 
              Previous  ownership:  Elizabeth Howard   (2.58: this or 
                 Nero C.IV); William Lambarde   (49.35: (1) this or (2) 
                 Vit. E.XVIII: see below). 
              Loans: Patrick Young ¢.1616 (49.35, 134.26: (1) this or (2) 
                 Vit. E.XVIII, and see below); Lord William Howard, 
                 1621 (2.58: this or Nero C.IV); James  Ussher  (this 
                 is probably one of the psalters in the Gallican version 
                 that Ussher borrowed   in 1625: Jul. C.III, fol. 383. 
                 For his collation, see Bodl., MS Add. A.91 (SC 27719), 
                 fol. 111.) 
              As Vit. E.XVIII was in Robert Bowyer’s hands in 1590 and 
                 as Lambarde  died in 1601, it is much more likely that 
                the psalter owned  by the latter (49.35) was Tib. C.VI 
                rather than Vit., in which case the manuscript borrowed 
               by  Young will also have been Tib. On grounds of size, 
                 moreover, Tib. fits the loan to Young better than Vit. 
                 and was the manuscript preferred by Ker in his identi- 
                 fication of that loan: Ker, Catalogue of Anglo-Saxon 
                MSS,  p. lv. 
              William  Lisle’s request in 1622 (Jul. C.III, fol. 239) to 
                examine  a psalter owned by Cotton may refer to either 
                this manuscript or Vit. E.XVIII, although there is no 
                evidence that he used either of them: Graham, ‘L'Isle’s 
                letters to Cotton’, pp. 365-66.
