CLAUDIUS     A.XI Letters of Anselm. 
   Catalogues: 6018, no. 248; 36789, fol. 117; 36682. 
   Fol. 9, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus’. 
   Previous ownership:  Thomas  Cranmer   (fol. 9). For a 
     discussion of the possibility that the manuscript may 
    subsequently have been owned by Lord Lumley (perhaps 
     to be identified with the entry, ‘Anselmi epistolae, manu- 
     script’ in Lumley’s catalogue), see Selwyn, LTC, 161-62, 
     282. See also Jayne & Johnson, Lumley Library, no. 45. 
   Loans: Patrick Young, ¢.1616 (49.6); John Selden, ¢.1638 
     (163.19: this or Nero A.VII). The annotations on fols 9v, 
     10, 12, 31, ete., are almost certainly by Young. 
   Names:  ‘Edmunde  [or Edwarde]  Lambard’  and, in the 
     same hand,  ‘289’, possibly an inventory number (fol. 
     162); ‘Edmund [?] Graydon’ and a (separate) ‘195’ (fol. 
     164). Michelle Brown kindly read the second name. 
   This volume was  used by Selden and  listed (‘Anselmes 
     Epistles’) as a Cotton manuscript in his Historie of 
     Tithes, 1618. His quotation on pp. 376-77 is from letter 
     no. 195 on fol. 97v of A-XI. 
   Extracts by Richard James are in Bodl., MS James 18 (SC 
     3855), p. 121. 
   Noted as ‘wanting, probably in the late 1630s (122.8).
