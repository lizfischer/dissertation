* JULIUS E.VII AElfric, sermons. 

 Catalogues: 35213, fol. 43v (see also below); 6018, no. 179; 
 36789, fol. 80; 36682. 
 Fol. 3, ‘Thomas Cotton’. 
 Ker, Catalogue of Anglo-Saxon MSS, no. 162, suggested 
 that E.VII might once have been bound with Tib. B.II, 
 fols 2-85. This appears to be confirmed by the entry in 
 35213, fol. 43v (‘Vita Sancti Edmundi martiris et vita 
 Sanctorum Saxonice ab Ailfrico abbatu foll’), in which 
 case the division must have been carried out by Cotton 
 and at a date preceding the entry in 6018. 
 Annexes 3b, 8a.
