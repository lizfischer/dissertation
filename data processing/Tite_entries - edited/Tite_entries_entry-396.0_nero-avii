     Of the constituent parts of the manuscript, at least fols 
       1-39y, art. 1, were in Cotton’s hands before 1613: the 
       extract (‘Lanfranci Epistola MS in Bibliothec. Cottonian 
       .. 2), printed by James Ussher in his De Christianarum 
       ecclesiarum ... successione (London, 1613), p. 182, is 
       taken from fol. 28. The same article was used by Selden 
       and listed (Lanfranks  Epistles’) as a Cotton manu- 
       script in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. His extract on 
       p. 227 is from fol. 13v of A-VII. 
    Fols 132-57y, art. 5, may be the ‘treatise written in Irishe 
       de Ecclesia’ which  Ussher, while  bishop  of Meath 
       (1621-25), asked to borrow: Jul. C.III, fol. 380. See R. ©
