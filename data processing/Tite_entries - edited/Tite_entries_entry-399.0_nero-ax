    Previous ownership: (of fols 41-130, art. 3) ? Henry Savile 
      (Watson, Savile of Banke, no. 274). Despite Watson's con- 
      tention that fols 41-130 (Pearl and Sir Gawain) are not 
      entered in 6018, they are probably embraced by the entry 
      there of â€˜Gesta Arthurii regis et aliorwz versu anglico.
