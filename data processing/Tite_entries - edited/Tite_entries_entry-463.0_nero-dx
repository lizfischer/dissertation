  Catalogues: 6018, no. 193; 36789, fols 15-15v; 36682. 
  Fols 3, 105, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus’. 
  A letter of 1613 to Cotton from Edward Mountsteven may 
    explain the acquisition of fols 138v-39, art. 6: Harl. MS 
    7002, fol. 261. 
  Loans: John  Speed, c.1612 (50.4: this or Otho D.VIID; 
    Arthur Agarde,  1612-15 (71.9, 77.1); Jarvis Bradgate, 
    1640 (204.1). 
  Fols 140-54,  art. 7, used by John  Selden and  listed 
    (Matriculus  ecclesiarum in_Archidiacon. Leicest’) as 
    a Cotton manuscript  in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. 
    His reference on p. 385 gives the same date, ‘5.H.3', 
    as the annotation on fol. 140 of the manuscript. The 
    annotation, ‘Peclynton’, on fol. 142 may well be by 
    Selden. Nigel  Ramsay  (BL,  Department   of Manu- 
    scripts records) considers that William Burton made 
   use of  a transcript of this article, sent to him by 
    Selden, in his Description of Leicester Shire (London, 
    [1622]). 
  BL, Stowe MS  531, apparently a volume derived from the 
    collections of William Le Neve, has at fol. 196 extracts 
    from fols 105-37y, artt. 3 and 4, of this manuscript, 
    there noted  as belonging to Cotton. Other  extracts, 
    probably made  in 1639, are in Bodl., MS Dodsworth 78 
    (SC 5019), fol. 63. 
  In 1625, a ‘very ancient Greek MS. Copy of the council of 
    Nice’ was,jn the hands of ‘Mr John Boyse’ (no doubt the 
    Bible translator), from whom  Cotton  hoped, unsuc- 
    cessfully, to obtain it: Elrington, Works of Ussher, XV, 
    p. 302; Bodl., MS Smith 21 (SC 15628), p. 63.
