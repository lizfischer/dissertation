CLEOPATRA      A.XV  Treatise concerning suits in Chancery. 
     Catalogues: 36789, fol. 156, no. 11; 36682. 
     The  wording of the title-page (fol. 1) makes it clear that, 
       despite the entries in Smith and Planta’s Catalogues, 
       this was not the copy found amongst Edward Saunders’ 
       papers, but rather a transcript of it. Moreover, the title- 
       page and  text are in the same hand.
