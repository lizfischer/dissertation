OXFORD,     ST  JOHN’S   COLLEGE,     MS 17 Annals. 
    Catalogue: 6018, no. 235 (this + Nero C.VII, fols 80-84, 
       art. 13). 
    Cotton's entry in 6018 makes it certain that he hoped to 
      keep  the whole  of the  manuscript which  he  had 
       obtained from St John’s College. When, at William 
       Laud’s entreaty (letter of 22 November,  1623, in 
      Jul.C.II1, fol. 232), he was prevailed upon to return the 
      bulk of it to the college, he retained the folios now in 
      Nero   C.VII: N.R. Ker,  ‘Membra   disiecta, British 
      Museum    Quarterly,  12  (1937-38),  131-32, Ker, 
      Catalogue of Anglo-Saxon MSS, no. 360.
