         Previous ownership: Many  of the papers in this volume 
           addressed to Thomas Bodley are originals: this suggests 
           that Bodley may himself have passed these to Cotton. 
         Papers in this volume may be among those sent to Cotton 
           by Ralph Starkey, possibly in 1625: Jul. C.III, fol. 362. 
         Fol. 2, art. 1, fols 69-72v, art. 32, fols 88-89, art. 42, etc., 
           are in the hand of a scribe who worked for Cotton. 
         Loan: Bulstrode Whitelocke, 1652 (231.31).
