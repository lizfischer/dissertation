p. 69. Stubbs further notes that D.VII was very prob- 
         ably the manuscript used by  Roger Twysden  for his 
         edition of Ralph in his Historiae Anglicanae scriptores 
         decem (London,  1652). In ‘Lectori’, sig. 3.A, Twysden 
         records Selden’s help in making borrowings from the 
         Cotton library.
