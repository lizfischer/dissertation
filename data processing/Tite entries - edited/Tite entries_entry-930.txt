annotation on fol. 3 appears to be in L'Isle’s hand and 
     arguing that this manuscript may well have been  the 
     source of a reference published by Lisle in 1623 in A 
     Saxon  Treatise from  Book  I of the Liber  Eliensis. 
     Graham  also suggests that an erased inscription on fol. 
     95 of Dom. XV  can be read as including the letters ‘Au’ 
     and  ‘t, probably of ‘Augustine’, Lindsell’s first name. 
     However,  the difficulty with this identification is that 
     Dom.  XV  must almost certainly have been in Cotton's 
     hands  well before  1622. A  loan (71.37) to Arthur 
     Agarde, d. 1615, reads; ‘Item a Book of Ely in 4° old 
     bound  having the lyf of St Ethelred in it it was Mr 
     Austen steward’. Dom. XV is the only Ely manuscript in 
     the Cotton collection to contain a life of St Etheldreda, 
     while the fact that Augustine Steward is recorded as its 
     previous  owner  opens  up  the possibility that the 
     inscription on fol. 95 is associated with him rather than 
     with Lindsell. (For a more detailed investigation of this 
     last point, see the entry for Dom.) If, therefore, Dom. 
    XVis  to be ruled out as the manuscript passed to Cotton 
     in 1622 (and presumably that listed at 3.5), either Vesp. 
     A.XIX  or the manuscript listed as no. 271 of 6018 (and 
     now  missing) may  be  alternatives. The entry at 3.5 
     does not entirely describe A.XTX but could well accord 
     with no, 271 (Historia Eliensis Monasterii libri tres, . . 
     Inseruntur  etiam  successive  transcriptio omnium 
     cartarum  .. 2, an entry in Cotton’s hand). Moreover, in 
     the margin  against no. 271 is written, also by Cotton, 
     ‘Doctor Lindsey’, In addition, the entry for no. 271 
     indicates that the manuscript may have included  the 
     material published by  Lisle in 1623, although none 
     of this analysis precludes the possibility that he also 
     consulted Dom.  XV. 
   Previous ownership: (of fols 104-21y, art. 7) ? William 
     Camden   (E. M. C. van Houts, ‘Camden, Cotton and the 
     chronicles of the Norman   Conquest  of England’, in 
     Wright, Cotton as Collector, p. 243, argues for Camden's 
     ownership   on the  grounds  that he  printed  these 
     folios in Anglica, Hibernica, Normannica, Cambrica, a 
     veteribus scripta (Frankfort, 1602), stating in  the 
     subtitle to that edition that he was using manuscripts 
     from  his own library. Fols 104-21v are listed in the 
     Richmond    Palace  inventory of  1535:  see Carley, 
     Libraries of Henry VIII, p. xxiii, H1.113. 
   Loans: Peter Balle, 1651 (127: this, Tib. A-VI, Claud. C.XI, 
     Nero  A-XV,  XVI,  Tit. A.I or Dom.   XV);  William 
     Dugdale, 1656 (Appx  XLVI, fol. 1v). 
   The annotation at the foot of fol. 55, art. 3, is probably by 
     Camden. 
   For Cotton's work in supplying fols lv, 28 and 103v (prob- 
     ably taken by him  from the same  manuscript as Jul. 
     A.XI, fol. 115v), see Brown, ‘Cotton, collector and con- 
     noisseur?’, pp. 290-91.
