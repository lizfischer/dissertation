in John  Parker's library (Strongman,  ‘John Parker's 
              manuscripts, 22) is the first article here, although the 
              latter is folio in size. 
            Name:  ‘Shon H< >’ (fol. 8). 
            Loan: Patrick Young, 1621 (2.31). 
           Fol. 178, art. 3(d), was (as noted on the folio by Frederic 
              Madden)  printed by Augustine Vincent  in 1622 in his 
              Discoverie of Errors, pp. 301-3. Vincent recorded it as 
             then  in the Cotton library, a reference I owe to Nigel 
              Ramsay.
