GALBA   AN  Psalms. 
     Catalogues: 6018, no. 118; 36789, fol. 10v; 36682. 
     This may have been  one of the psalters in the Gallican 
       version that James Ussher borrowed  from Cotton in 
       1625: Jul. C.II, fol. 383. Ussher certainly knew of the 
       manuscript: see Ker, MLGB, p. 191, quoting from Bodl., 
       MS  Add. A.91 (SC 27719), fol. 73v.
