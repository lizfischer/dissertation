?* NERO   AVI  Chronicle of the kings of England from Aelle 
                 to 1400; records relating to London; etc. 
              Catalogues: 6018, no. 129 (to art. 23); 36682. 
               Despite the omission from  6018 of later articles, fols 
                 71-191, artt. 6-37, have a continuous pre-Cottonian 
                 foliation. The manuscript may have come to Cotton in 
                 its present form or have been created by him from two 
                 or three parts - fols 3-70, artt. 1-5, fols 71-191, artt. 
                 6-37 and fols 192-97, artt. 38-39. 
               Possibly the manuscript extracted by Richard James in 
                 Bodl., MS James 24 (SC 3861), pp. 16-24.
