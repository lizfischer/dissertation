Extracts in BL, Stowe MS  528, fols 249v-50, are taken 
    from fols 166v and 163, art. 2 (Pipewell), of B-XTV, and 
    the original is noted as in Cotton's hands. 
  This  manuscript was  missing from  the Cotton library 
    before Thomas  Smith  drew up his Catalogue of 1696. 
    He  therefore entered another volume under B.XIV, the 
    Lenton  cartulary: this had been owned by Scipio Le 
    Squyer  (Ovenden, ‘Scipio Le Squyer’, 325 and n. 14), 
    was  given to the library by Samuel Roper, junior, of 
    Heanor  in the 1670s, probably as early as 1670 (the date 
    of his gift of Claud. A.XIII and Nero E.VII ), and was 
    destroyed in the fire of 1731. The Sheen-Pipewell Otho 
    was bought by the British Museum in 1787 and restored 
    to its previous pressmark. See  Davis, MC,  no. 551. 
    Planta’s suggestion (Catalogue) that it may once have 
    been  Otho B.1 is incorrect: ef. the catalogue entries in 
    36682, and  Bodl., MS Dodsworth 78 (SC 5019), fol. 41, 
    extracts probably made in 1639. (Other extracts are in 
    MS   Dodsworth   108  (SC  5049), fol. 39, and  MS 
    Dodsworth  136 (SC 5077), fol. 49.)
