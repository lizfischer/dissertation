OXFORD,  BODLEIAN  LIBRARY, MS DODS- 

    WORTH       76  (SC   5018)  Collections of  Roger 
    Dodsworth. 
  Loan: Roger Dodsworth,  1622 (2.120: ? this). 
  Fols 56-64, 121-23, are fragments of a St Mary’s register. 
    The  first group of leaves is quarto in size, the second 
    folio, and either or both  could fit the description 
    ‘unbound’ in the loan to Dodsworth. All these pages 
    have, however,  been  assigned to the ownership  of 
    Christopher Hatton (Davis, MC, nos 1098, 1099, 1105; 
    see also Bodl., MS Dugdale 48 (SC 6536), fol. 63v). As 
    far as concerns fols 56-64 this is undoubtedly correct: 
    William Dugdale, Monasticon Anglicanum,  I (London, 
    1655), pp. 393-94, prints material which is to be found 
    in these folios and says that it is ‘Ex fragmento Registri 
    S. Mariae Ebor. in bibl. Hattoniana’ (wording which, 
    however,  echoes  the description  of the  unbound 
    Cottonian manuscript and may therefore indicate what 
    had become  of it). While there seems not to be the same 
    authority for the provenance of fols 121-23 the proba- 
    bility must also favour Hatton, although it is possible 
    that these leaves could have reached Dodsworth   by 
    some  other route, even maybe as a consequence of loan 
    2.120.
