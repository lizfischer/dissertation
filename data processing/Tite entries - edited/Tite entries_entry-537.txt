GALBA    CI   Records and papers concerning England  and 
              the Low  Countries, 1576-80. 
            Catalogues: 35213, fol. 40v (? this); 36789, fols 6, 155v 
              (the ‘3 bookes . . . about the time of the Duke de Parma’, 
              listed on this folio, may be  Galba  C.VI-VIII), 163; 
              36682. 
            The  manuscript is now in two parts and the presence of a 
              title-page at the start of part II suggests that this has 
              long  been the arrangement.  On  the other hand,  the 
              verso foliation provided by the Commissioners of 1703 
              numbers  the two parts as one (see, e.g., part II, fol. 84v, 
              ‘260’; and , for the work of the Commissioners, see Tite, 
              Manuscript  Library, p. 37). 
            Part I, fols 1-2v, art. 1, fols 24-27, art. 11, and part II, fols 
               134-36, art. 63, are in the hand of a scribe who worked 
              for Cotton. 
            Loan:  Bulstrode Whitelocke, 1652 (231.16). 
            Organizational notes by Cotton.
