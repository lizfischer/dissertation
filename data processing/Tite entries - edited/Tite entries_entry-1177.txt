TITUS   C.XV  Codex purpureus. 
     Catalogues: no entries. 
    The opening words of the heading on fol. 2 and the similar 
       heading on fol. 4 (Fragmentum  ...) are in Richard 
       James's hand. 
     It has been suggested that fol. 1 was taken from what is 
       now Cambridge, St Johnâ€™s College, MS H.13. As three 
       other leaves elsewhere in Cottonian manuscripts may 
      well have come from the same source, it is possible that 
       Cotton was  responsible for the transfers: see Otto 
       Pacht, The Master of Mary  of Burgundy   (London, 
       1948), pp. 64, 69, and The Vespasian Psalter, ed. by
