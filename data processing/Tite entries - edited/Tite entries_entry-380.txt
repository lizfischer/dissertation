                taken out of an olde Ligger booke . . . of St Albones. . .in 
                y* possession of Mr Thomas Fortescue’. These notes are 
                in CUL, MS  Ee.3.44, pp. 1-18, and their sources can be 
                found in art. 7 of the manuscript at the folio numbers 
                cited in the notes.). The note, ‘Hue usque cum libro 
                M"  Fortescu’, in Cotton's hand on fol. 62 of Nero D.I, is 
                presumably  a reference to E.IV, art. 7.
