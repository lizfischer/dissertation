       Edward  Russell asked to borrow this manuscript, 1607 
         (Jul. C.II, fol. 318). 
       In 1612 Edmond  Ashfielde wrote to ask for information 
         from this manuscript (Jul. C.IH, fol. 5). He and Russell 
         were  both investigating the rights of neighbouring 

        livings.
