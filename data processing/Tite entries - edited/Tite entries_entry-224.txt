               Previous ownership:  (of fols 2-6, art. 1) Henry Savile 
                 (Watson, Savile of Banke, no. 102). 
               Previous ownership: (of fols 8-159, art.2) Robert Glover 
                 (BL, Lansdowne   MS  58, fol. 105 is a list of Glover's 
                 books, in which  item F  is a Pipewell cartulary; the 
                 genealogies in the margins of fols 95v, 104, 127v, 146 of 
                 Calig. A.XII are in Glover's hand. I am  grateful to 
                 Pamela  Selwyn for advice on these points. Robert Beale 
                 made  extracts from a Pipewell cartulary belonging to 
                 Glover: Add. MS  32100, fol. 219.). 
               Loans: Richard  St George, by 1614 (15.4: this + Calig. 
                 A.XIII, or Otho B.XIV); Arthur Agarde, 1612-15 (71.19, 
                 77.9: this + Calig. A.XIII); Mr Morgan, 1616 (109.1: this 
                 + Calig. A-XII); Henry  Montagu,  1621 (2.21: this or 
                 Calig. A-XIII);  Humphrey     Henchman    for  John 
                 Williams, ? 1624 (2.102: this or Calig. A-XIII); Perey 
                 Herbert, by the hand  of Knasbrough   and Vaughan, 
                 1661/2 (267.1). 
               Fols 23v, 159v have annotations by Richard Gascoigne, 
                 the second noting the foliation of the volume (cf. Faust. 
                 B.I). This manuscript and Calig. A-XIII were probably 
                the source of extracts he made in his book ‘T’: see Bodl., 
                 MS  Dodsworth   127 (SC 5068),  fol. 120v. There are 
                 further extracts in MS Dodsworth 136 (SC 5077), fol. 
                 49, and by William Dugdale,  made in 1638, in Bodl., 
                 MSS  Dugdale 12 (SC 6502), p. 187, and Dugdale 15 (SC 
                 6505), p.55. 
               The  cartularies in Calig. A-XII and XIII  were  once 
                 foliated in a single sequence, s.xvii", and must still have 
                 been combined   at the time of the loan  to Morgan 
                 (109.1) in 1616, as the volume there lent is described as 
                 ‘old bound’ by contrast with the wording of the loan of 
                 1621 (2.21).
