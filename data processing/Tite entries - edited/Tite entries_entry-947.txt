VESPASIAN      BVII  Statutes of England; Modus   tenendi 
                 parliamentum;  etc. 
               Catalogues: 6018, nos 147 (deleted) and 289; 36682. The 
                 entry at no. 147 is almost certainly of this manuscript 
                 and it is probable that the erased number  on  fol. i, 
                 replaced by ‘289’, was ‘147’. However, the first item listed 
                 at no. 147 (‘Calendarium vetus’) differs from the first 
                 item at no. 289 (‘Nomina regum Angliae Christianorum 
                 ad Hen  8’): the latter is now the first article in the 
                 manuscript. The  entry at no. 147 lists the articles in 
                 their modern order, but the manuscript contents-table, 
                 no. 289 and 36682  both give the Modus  at the end of 
                 the manuscript. 
               Fol. 4, ‘Robertus Cotton’. 
               Names:  ? ‘Willm Johnson’; ? Edward ? Hoby (fol. 107v). 
               Cotton's annotation, ‘Scrap out this pag’, on fols 5v and 6, 
                 art. 2, accounts for the partial erasure of these leaves. 
               The binding of this manuscript was done for Cotton but 
                 in his binding instructions (on fol. iv) he stipulated that 
                 the cover should be  decorated with an  ‘Ovall in the 
                 midest but not my armes  for it is not of my books . . :. 
                 Cotton must, nevertheless, have retained the book. The 
                 oval is still present on both covers (and not solely on the 
                 front cover, as I erroneously implied in my ‘Manuscript 
                 records of Parliament’, 130 n. 38).
