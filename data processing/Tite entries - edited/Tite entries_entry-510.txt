 Catalogues: 6018, nos 114, 330 (330 is entered twice, on 
   fols 120v and 121); 36789, fols 12v-13; 36682. 
 Fol. 1, ‘Robertus Cotton Bruceus 1612’; fol. 3, ‘Robertus 
   Cotton Bruceus’. 
 Previous ownership: Thomas Dakcombe, 1542 (fol. 1); Lord 
   Lumley (Jayne & Johnson, Lumley  Library, no. 755); ? 
   Prince Henry and / or ? Royal library: Cotton listed the 
   manuscript among  ‘Books I want’, c.1609-12 (130.21). 
 Loan: James  Ussher, 1646 or 1647 (226.2). Ussher had 
   asked to borrow this manuscript from Cotton in 1625: 
   Jul. C.1I, fol. 383. 
 It has been suggested that fol. 2 was taken from what is 
   now  Cambridge, St John’s College, MS H.13. As three 
   other leaves elsewhere in Cottonian manuscripts may 
   well have come from the same source, it is possible that 
   Cotton was responsible for the transfers: see O. Pacht, 
   The Master of Mary of Burgundy  (London, 1948), pp. 
   64, 69, and The Vespasian Psalter, ed. by D.H. Wright 
   (Copenhagen, 1967), pp. 33-34; also Tite, ‘Lost or stolen 
   or strayed’, p. 296 n. 37. Michelle Brown has corrected 
   Piacht’s mistake of assigning this leaf to Galba A.XVII

and  adds further information about fol. 2 (which incor- 
                 porates a strew border from a fifteenth-century Flemish 
                  manuscript also used by Cotton in Nero A.II): ‘Cotton, 
                 collector and  connoisseur?,  pp. 288-89.   See also 
                 Watson,  D’Ewes, p. 89 n. 254. 
               The  inscription on fol. 16v, dating the writing of the 
                  manuscript to 703, is by Cotton.
