   Previous ownership: (of Smith art. 12, destroyed) ? Henry 
     Savile (Watson,  Savile of Banke, no. 186). Watson 
     points out that art. 12 may be the ‘Gemma virginalis in 
     carmine’, referred to in Thomas Talbot's notes in Vesp. 
      DVI,  fol. 45v: Savile of Banke, p. 80, where Talbot's 
     notes are printed. 
   D. Townsend,  ‘The Vita Sancti Fredemundi of Henry of 
     Ayranches’, Journal of Medieval  Latin, 4 (1994), 5, 
     suggests that Smith art. 4 may have been one  of the 
     texts of the life of St Fremund consulted by William 
      Camden. Nigel Ramsay develops the point further, not- 
     ing  (BL, Department  of MSS  records) that Camden 
      printed extracts from the life of St Birinus as well as 
      from that of St Fremund  (Smith artt. 3 and 4, both 
      destroyed) in his Britannia (London, 1587), pp. 361, 
      365-66, and suggesting that he may even have owned 
      both of these texts in D-XIV. 
    Extracts, marked as from this manuscript, are in James 
     Ware's notebook, Add. MS  4789, fol. 222.
