             believe that Richard James may have been responsible 
             for the manuscript’s removal from Oxford but note that 
             it is not known whether the four printed books once 
             owned  by Cotton and now in Jesus College library (one 
             of which was given by him in 1626) were compensation 
             for the alienation of the manuscript.).
