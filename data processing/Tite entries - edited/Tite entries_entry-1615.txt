LONDON,      BRITISH     LIBRARY,      ADDITIONAL 
       MS  15673 St John Chrysostom; Simon Islip, Speculum 
       regis Edwardi tertii; Celso Maffei; etc. 
     Previous ownership: John Russell, 1589 (fol. 116v). 
     Loan: Sir William Howard, 1640  (196.2). This loan was 
       probably the occasion of the loss of the manuscript 
       from the Cotton library: see Tite, ‘Lost or stolen or 
       strayed’, pp. 274-75. 
    The  contents-table on fol. 1 is by Richard James. The 
       marks on fols 30v, 31, 35, 36v, 37v, etc., and the anno- 
       tation on fol. 50v are also probably by him.
