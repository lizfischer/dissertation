LONDON,    WESTMINSTER        ABBEY 
            In 1623 John Williams, then dean of Westminster, made 
              a gift of books and manuscripts to the Abbey library 
              that he had  reconstituted three years earlier. Three 
              extant seventeenth-century lists of these manuscripts 
              were  published  by  Robinson  &  James,  MSS   of 
             Westminster  Abbey, in 1909: List B, a register of bene- 
              factors and their donations, compiled in 1623; List A, 
              drawn up in 1672; and List C which was made for CMA 
              and published there in 1697, three years after almost all 
              the manuscripts had been destroyed by fire. 
            As there can be virtually no doubt that the manuscript of 
              Lucian that Cotton transferred to Patrick Young, c.1616 
              (134.27), is identical with that given to the Abbey 
              library by Williams in 1623 (CMA, no. 1139), and as 
              there is a strong likelihood that the works of Prosper 
              and Cyprian in the same transaction (49.42, 134.32) 
              followed the same route, to become CMA, no. 1131, it is 
              by no means  impossible that other untraced manu- 
              scripts which passed from Cotton to Young were later 
              also among those presented by Williams to his library. 
              While no  proof of this is available, it is noteworthy 
              that a further four titles, either unidentified or only 
              tentatively identified in the Cotton-Young lists, appear 
              among   Williamsâ€™ donation (CMA,   nos 1156, 1185, 
              1260, and  Robinson &  James, MSS   of Westminster 
             Abbey, List  B no. 163) and that, of the total of six 
              manuscripts, five appear in one subsection of list 134 
              (134.29-33). 
            If these Westminster Abbey books do indeed form a group 
              of manuscripts which passed successively through the 
              hands of Cotton and then Young, it is tempting to think 
              that Williams solicited them from one or other as a gift. 
              But as the 1623 register (List B) reads, these manu- 
              scripts were given by Williams rather than by someone
