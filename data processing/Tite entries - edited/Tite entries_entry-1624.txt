Fols 20-34v, art. 3, are in the hand of a scribe who worked 
    for Cotton. Fols 104—15y, part of art. 8, and fols 295-99, 
    art. 17, are in the hand of Ralph Starkey. 
  Probably put together by Cotton in 1619 or soon after- 
    wards: see art. 16 An early binding is preserved in the 
    British Library: this does not bear Cotton’s arms, as in 
    Joan 2.118, but may not be original. According to a note, 
    s.xvii®*/s.xviii, in a volume of extracts from a copy of 
    a Cotton  manuscript concerned  with  Chancery, the 
    original (presumably this manuscript) was in the hands 
    of ‘Mr Grimes the late Usher of the Rolls’: BL, Hargrave 
    MS  219, fol. 2. 
  The loan to Montagu, 1640, was probably the occasion of 
    the loss of the manuscript from the Cotton library: Tite, 
    ‘Lost or stolen or strayed’, p. 279.
