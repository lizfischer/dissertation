*  VESPASIAN      B.X   Life of  St  Brendan;  Ethicus, 
      Cosmographia;  ete. 
    Catalogues: 36789, fol. 68 (of fols 1-21, artt. 1-2); 36682. 
    Previous ownership:  (of fols 24-30, art. 5) John Dee 
      (Roberts & Watson,  Dee, DM33;  see also fol. 24); (of 
      fols 31-124, art. 6) Dee, 1565 (Roberts & Watson, Dee, 
      M80;  see also fols 31, 122v). 
    Name:  ‘P. Saunders’ (fol. 24). 
    Fols 1-23 and Tit. A-XVIII once formed one volume, of 
      which   Fragments   XXIX,   fols 36-39,  were   the 
      endleaves: Ker, MLGB,  p. 73. Presumably Cotton was 
      responsible for the rearrangement. Fol. 37v of Fragments 
      XXIX   carries an contents-table of the volume before 
      it was divided. For the pre-Dissolution owners of that 
      volume (whose names  are recorded in Tit. A-XVIII), see 
      Crick, HRB, no. 93, and Watson, MLGB Supp. p. 99. In 
      addition, there is an erased inscription on fol. 85 of 
      A.XVIII which may  include the name of another owner. 
    Art. 3 in 36682 (‘Miscellanea de consumatione mundi de 
      peregrinatione ad  Roman   de  Merlini  prophetiis’), 
      which is also entered in Richard James's contents-table 
      in B.X, is no longer to be found in any of the three 
      original parts of the manuscript.
