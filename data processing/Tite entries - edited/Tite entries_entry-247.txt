*  CALIGULA       B.X  Records  and  papers  concerning 
                  England and Scotland, 1558-67. 
               Catalogue: 36682 (no entry in the catalogue but recorded 
                  as present in the 1656/7 checklist, fol. 1). 
                Fol. 2, 1603./Ro: Cotton Bruceus’; ‘Thomas C[otto]n’. 
                Loan: William Camden,  1612-16 (75.2). 
                Much of the volume consists of papers sent to or written 
                  by William  Cecil. No  doubt  these constituted the 
                  volume acquired by  Cotton by 1603;  the transcripts 
                  and copies may be later additions. 
                Fol. 107, art. 53, is probably listed in Faust. CII, fol. 206v, 
                  art. 44 (a ‘Calender or Cataloge off Mr Cotton's 4 bookes 
                  AB.C.D. of Treaties Actes & monuments 1600’). 
               Organizational marks by Cotton.
