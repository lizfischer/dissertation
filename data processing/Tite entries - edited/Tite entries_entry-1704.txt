This or the earlier version of the cartulary, Vit. EXV, must 
       be the  manuscript  that  Richard  Montague   asked 
       Cotton to lend him: Jul. C.1I, fol. 276 (undated letter, 
       possibly ¢.1617). 
    This manuscript  or Vit. E.XV used by John  Selden and 
       listed (‘Chartular[y] ... of the Abbey of Osney’) as a 
       Cotton manuscript   in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. 
       Despite Selden’s fairly extensive references (on pp. 
       306-8, 357, 397-402),  they do not appear  to reflect 
       sufficiently precisely the content and order in either 
       manuscript to make  it possible to determine which of 
       the two was his source. It is, in fact, not impossible that 
       he used both manuscripts,  as both were probably  in 
       Cotton’s possession when  Selden was  preparing  his 
       book. 
    Cotton exchanged  this manuscript for the Burton annals, . 
       now in Vesp. E.III, probably not long before 1621: see 
       Tite, ‘Lost or stolen or strayed’, pp. 267-68 and 296 n. 
       39. H.E. Salter’s suggestion that the manuscript was 
       not bound before Cotton’s time is incorrect: in loan 71.3 
       the manuscript is described as ‘old bound’, evidence 
       which, as Cotton provided it with his own binding, may 
       also indicate that the manuscript came into his hands 
       only shortly before that loan was made: Cartulary of 
       Oseney Abbey, ed. by H.E.  Salter (Oxford Historical 
       Society, 89, etc., 1929-36), IV, p. vii. 
    Annexes  7a, 8p. 
    lam  grateful to the Archivist at Christ Church for consent 
       to examine this manuscript.
