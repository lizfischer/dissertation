* JULIUS   C.II Transcripts of Anglo-Saxon and other laws, 
      and from the Textus Roffensis; John Herd, history of 
      England; ete. 
    Catalogues: 6018, no. 319; 36789, fols 121v-23; 36682. 
    Previous ownership: (of fols 1-18v, art. 1) ‘Mr Dobson’ 
      (70.3, 111.3). 
    Previous ownership: (of fols 42-80, artt. 5-16) Francis 
      Tate (signatures on fols 42 (dated 1589), 52 (1613), 68v 
      (1590); see also 23.4: this or Nero A.I). Of these folios, 
      Ker attributed fols 52v-57 (recte 52-57v) to Lambarde 
      and fol. 68v to Tate (Catalogue of Anglo-Saxon MSS, nos 
      164, 224b). He presumably derived Lambarde’s owner- 
      ship from the heading to fol. 52: ‘Ex libro admodum 
      antiquo, quem habet dominus  Joannes Jocelinus 1580. 
      Novemb.  W. Lambert’  to which has been added, in a 
      different style of hand, ‘remanet apud Robertum Cotton 
      militem & baronettum  27 Maii 1613. F. Tate’. However, 
      the presence of Lambarde's  ‘signature’ here (and on 
      fol. 60) is deceptive. The hand is not Lambarde’s but 
      Tate's; Lambarde is not therefore testifying to Joscelyn’s 
      ownership of the  liber antiquus (Nero A.1), as Ker 
      assumed; instead, Tate is recording that that manu- 
      script had been owned first by Joscelyn and then (rather 
      more ambiguously) by Lambarde   (whose ownership is, 
      nevertheless, confirmed by  21.4), and Tate  is also 
      responsible for the later addition noting Cotton's acqui- 
     sition of it. In addition, the text of fols 42-80 is in his 
     hand.  (This analysis is based on an examination  of 
     Tate’s Anglo-Saxon, secretary and italic hands of which 
     Faust. ELV, fols 107-8, provide good examples; and on 
     the style of Lambarde's undoubted signature, for which 
     see Jul. CY, fol. 25v, and Harl. MS 6996, fol. 122. I owe

thanks  to Michelle Brown   for help in making  these 
           comparisons.) For  a very unlikely connection of these 
           folios with John  Dee,  see Roberts  &  Watson,  Dee, 
           Addenda,  no. 14. 
         Previous ownership: (of fols 92-96, art. 19) ? Robert Hare 
           (as noted in 6018, no. 319, art. 19). See Watson, ‘Hare’, 
           p. 214 and no. 26. 
         Previous ownership:  (of fols 279-86,  artt. 26 and 27) 
           Henry  Savile (Watson, Savile of Banke, no. 233). 
         Loans: (of at least fols 1-18y, art. 1) Hart, 1612 (70.3); (of 
           at least fols 42-80, artt. 5-16) ? Francis Bacon, ? by 1613 
           (23.4: (1) this or (2) Nero A.D); (of at least fols 1-18v, 
           art. 1) Hart, by 1617 (111.3). 
         Fols 19-39, 273-74y, artt. 2-4, 24, are in Arthur Agarde’s 
           hand  (as also noted in 6018, no. 319, artt. 3, 17). 
         Extracts, marked  as from this manuscript, are in James 
           Ware's  notebook,  Bodl., MS   Rawlinson   B.479  (SC 
           11826), fol. 77v.
