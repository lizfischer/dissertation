70-77, art. 24) is detailed in the intervening loans (16.6, 
        45.5, 111.27) to Kniveton. The volume is largely Cotton's 
        creation, with a few later additions. Several articles (e.g. 
        fol. 23, art. 4, fol. 28, art. 8, fols 38-46y, art. 10) are in 
        the hand  of a scribe who  worked  for him. The  manu- 
        script was probably  lost as a result of loan 2.52: ‘Liber 
        Ri St George  Clarenceux’  is on fol. 1. See Tite, ‘Lost or 
        stolen or strayed’, pp. 275-76.]
