               Catalogue: 36682. 
               Previous ownership: ? Thomas Gatacre. According to an 
                 annotation by Smith against the C.XIV entry in his own 
                 copy of his Catalogue (Bodl., MS Smith 140 (SC 15738)), 
                 this or perhaps  another copy  of similar material 
                 belonged to Gatacre. Smith cites (from Parr, Ussher, 
                 pp. 37 and 56) two letters, of 1616 and 1617 (reprinted 
                 in Elrington, Works of Ussher, XV, pp. 93, 117), from 
                 Gatacre to James Ussher, which establish that Gatacre 
                 owned one copy and Ussher knew  of another.
