                by H.H.E. Craster, The Parish of Tynemouth: history of 
                Northumberland,   vol. 8 (Newcastle-upon-Tyne   and 
                 London, 1907), p. 49 n. 2; and see also p. 47 n. 1. 
              Extracts from this manuscript, made by Augustine Baker, 
                 are in Oxford, Jesus College, MS 77, fol. 65, and by 
                 Richard St George  in BL, Lansdowne   MS  863, fols 
                 55-56v, 78v-8lv, and 83v-86v (those on fols 85v-86 
                being  printed by Selden on  pp. 327-28). Those  by 
                 Roger Dodsworth   in Bodl., MS  Dodsworth   78 (SC 
                 5019), fols 60, 68, were probably made in 1639. 
              There  is firm evidence that Fortescue owned   two or 
                 possibly more ‘leiger-books’ of St Albans. One of these 
                 — the subject of two letters from Fortescue in 1599 and 
                 1600 (BL, Egerton MS 2714, fol. 31, and Harl. MS 4712, 
                 fol. 309, cited by Davis, MC, no. 848) - contained infor- 
                 mation  relating to  former  St  Albans’  lands in 
                 Buckinghamshire; while extracts (in CUL, MS Ee.3.44, 
                 pp. 1-55) from two books in his ownership deal mainly 
                with Wymondham     (a cell of St Albans). The source of 
                 the first of these extracts has been identified as Claud. 
                 E.IV but, although it is described in that extract as a 
                “Ligger booke . . . of St Albones . . .in y* possession of Mr 
                Thomas   Fortescue’, Claud. E.IV does not match the 
                 description of the Fortescue cartulary given to Cotton 
                 by Agarde (18.9, 71.5) or the manuscript lent to Lord 
                William dealing with land he had purchased in Durham 
                 (110.1, 111.14). Either Tib. E.VI or Otho D.III would 
                 seem more  likely to be the manuscript received from 
                Agarde. Unfortunately, both were badly damaged in the 
                 fire of 1731 but each contains material from the home 
                counties and may therefore answer to the description in 
                 Fortescue's letters. However, D.III seems to be confined 
                to the south of England and  this may make E.VI the 
                 more likely of the two candidates for the loan to Lord 
                William.
