         There  is no entry for B.XV   in any other of the  early 
           catalogues and Smith, Catalogue, lists it as ‘Deest’. In a 
           letter of 1697 to Sir John Cotton, Smith again recorded 
           the absence of this manuscript and three.others: see the 
           entry for Vit. B.I.
