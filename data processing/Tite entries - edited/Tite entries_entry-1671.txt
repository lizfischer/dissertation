LONDON,    BRITISH    LIBRARY,    ROYAL   MS  16GVI 
            Chroniques de France, vol. 1, to death of St Louis, 1270. 
          Previous ownership: ? Prince Henry, if this is the manu- 
            script entered by Cotton as one of the ‘Books I want’, 
            ¢.1609-12 (130.5), although if this is the manuscript 
            listed in the Richmond  Palace inventory of  1535 
            Henry's ownership is unlikely: see Carley, Libraries of 
            Henry VUIT, H1.58.
