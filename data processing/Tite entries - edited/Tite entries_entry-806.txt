(see loan 2.85); fol. 228, art. 21, the English translation, 
           is in Richard James's hand; fols 231-32, art. 23, and 
           possibly fol. 299, art. 30, are in William Camden's 
           hand; fols 229-30y, art. 22, fols 233-9y, artt. 24, 25 are 
           not autograph,  although  the additions on  fol. 230 
           may just be by Agarde; fols 240-5iy, art. 26, also not 
           autograph, but these and / or parts of Jul. C:-VI, may 
           have been the source of transcripts later owned. by Simon 
           Archer, 1629: Jul. C.III, fol. 3 (a letter in which Archer 
           asks for a copy of John Rouse’s work on the antiquities 
           of Warwickshire, no doubt a reference to fols 252-55v, 
           art. 27); fol. 298v, art. 29, is annotated ‘Mr Gwynnes 
           Boke’, possibly the man referred to in loans 82.6-12. 
        According    to   Carl  Berkhout,   ‘Laurence   Nowell 
           (1530-ca.1570), in Medieval Scholarship: biographical 
           studies on the formation of a discipline, II: Literature 
           and Philology, ed. by H. Damico with D. Fennema & K. 
           Lenz (New  York and  London, 1998), p. 15, the manu- 
           script contains transcripts by Laurence Nowell. 
         It has been suggested by Nigel Ramsay (BL, records of the 
           Department   of MSS,  citing T. Powell, Repertorie of 
           Records (London, 1631), p. 133) that fols 229-30v, art. 
           22, and fols 235-39v, art. 25, or copies of these, may 
           have been the manuscript ‘deposited by Agarde in the 
           First Treasury at Westminster’. However, Powell's work, 
           published over fifteen years after Agarde’s death, reads 
           as though the latter's text was still to be found there, 
           while the Cotton folios are annotated by Sir Robert (on 
           fol. 235; heading and quire sig.). It is therefore unlikely 
           that these were Agarde’s deposited originals. 
        The  letter of 1576 from John Harpsfield to Dee on fol. 56 
           indicates that Harpsfield provided the original manu- 
           script which was one of the sources from  which Dee 
           made  his copy of Sigebertus Gemblicensis,  now  fols 
           3-57 of this manuscript. (See also W.H. Sherman, John 
           Dee: the politics of reading and writing in the English 
           Renaissance (Amherst, 1995), p. 121.) 
        Extracts, cited as from  this manuscript  in Bodl., MS 
           James 24 (SC 3861), p. 117, are in fact from Vit. C.X.
