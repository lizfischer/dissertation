fol. 69; (of fols 158-81, art. 3) Hatton, 1636 (Bodl., MS 
          Dodsworth  82 (SC 5023), fol. 34). 
        Fols 119-56vy, art. 2, have many annotations by William 
          Dugdale.  Davis, MC, nos 90, 987  and 1203, suggests 
          that artt. 1 and 3 may have been owned by Dugdale and 
          he draws attention to the annotations by Dugdale in art. 
          2, although (perhaps surprisingly) he does not suggest 
          him  as owner of that article. No firm evidence has yet 
          come  to light to support Dugdaleâ€™s ownership, although 
          the title-pages he provides to all four articles indicate a 
          greater degree of involvement  with this manuscript 
          than with others he assisted in acquiring for the Cotton 
         library.                eg
