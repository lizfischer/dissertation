Loans: Agarde, 1612-15 (71.8); Augustine Vincent, 1621-22 
              (2.106). For Vincent's extracts ‘Ex libro Prioratus de 
              Lacock mihi a Roberto Cotton mutuato. 24. Maii. anno 
              1622’, see London, College of Arms, MS Vincent 6, p. 
              321. Some   of his extracts printed in his Discoverie 
              of Errours, pp. 441-45,  are now  missing  from  the 
              damaged   manuscript: his first, relating to the founda- 
              tion of Bradenstoke Priory, must have been taken from 
              the destroyed folio following fol. 126v but others are 
              still legible on fol. 128v. 
            Extracts by Richard James are in Bodl., MS James 18 (SC 
              3855), p. 62.
