TIBERIUS     D.I Collections by Robert Bowyer  from the 
      Clerk’s journal books of the parliaments of Henry VIII 
      and Edward  VI. 
    Catalogue: 36682. 
    The  volume  was still owned by  Robert Bowyer  on  4 
      November,  1620 (see note on fol. 41v). Contrary to my 
      suggestion (in “The Cotton Library in the Seventeenth 
      Century  and  its manuscript records of the English 
      Parliament’, Parliamentary History, 14.2 (1995), 135), 
      it is unlikely to be the ‘diurnall of the parlement of the 
      kings time’ that Gilbert Gerrard asked to borrow on 16 
      December  (Jul. C.III, fol. 176): it is clear, from Gerrard’s 
      letter that the material he wished to see (probably now 
      in Tit. F.TV) had been in Cotton's possession for longer 
      than a few weeks. 
    This manuscript (and Tit. F.I and II) were mentioned by 
      Thomas  Smith, Sir John Cotton’s librarian, in a letter of 
      1699 to the lawyer, Walter Williams: Bodl., MS Smith 
      66 (SC 15772), p. 101.
