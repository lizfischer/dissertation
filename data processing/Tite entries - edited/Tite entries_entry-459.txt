  Simonds D’Ewes  asked to borrow this manuscript, 1626

  The extracts by Richard James in Bodl., MS James  18 
    (SC 3855), p. 145, are not from D.II but from Faust. B.V. 
  There are extracts, ‘ex Historia Roffensi, seemingly com-

missioned by James Ware  and possibly dating from the 
                 early 1630s, in Add. MS 4787, fol. 262. See fol. 249 for 
                 an indication of date.
