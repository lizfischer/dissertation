TIBERIUS     B.XII A  collection of documents, made  by 
         Thomas  Beckington, bishop of Bath and Wells, to fortify 
         the English claim to the French crown. 
       Catalogues: 6018, no. 361; 36789, fol. 156v, no. 29; 36682 
         (entry in Thomas Cottonâ€™s hand). 
       According  to F. Taylor and J.S. Roskell (Gesta Henrici 
         Quinti. The deeds of Henry V (Oxford 1975), p. xvi), fols 
         89-112  of Jul. E.IV were once part of Tib. B.XII but 
         there is no evidence that Cotton was responsible for the 
         separation.
