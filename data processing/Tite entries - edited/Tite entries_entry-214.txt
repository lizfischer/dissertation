edition of an extract in his Eutychii Aegyptii, patriar- 
           chae orthodoxorum   Alexandrini  ... ecclesiae® suae 
           origines (London, 1642) is in part based on A.IV, and 
           he had quoted from it in numerous works  previously, 
           first in his De dis Syris (Leiden, 1629). Selden was 
           probably introduced to the manuscript in about 1628 
           by Henry Jacob: see G.J. Toomer, Eastern Wisdome and 
           Learning: the study of Arabic in seventeenth-century 
           England (Oxford, 1996), p. 66. If correct, this provides 
           a likely date for the note in 6018 of Selden’s borrowing. 
           The annotation on fol. 220 of the manuscript, which 
           may be in Cotton’s hand, was probably written when 
           Thomas  Erpenius  was consulting the manuscript  in 
           about 1620 (the ‘E’ at the end of the note may refer to 
           him): see Selden, op. cit., p. vii. lowe much of this infor- 
           mation to Gerald Toomer  who  has also informed me 
           that the manuscript was on loan to Edward Pococke in 
           Oxford from 1652. 
         Listed as ‘wanting’, probably in the late 1630s (122.5) and 
           no doubt as a consequence of the loans to Selden. Also 
           listed ‘noted over, as wanting, now there’ (checklist of 
           1656/7: 36682, fol. 1), although the next entry on fol. 1, 
           dealing with A.VI, another missing manuscript, sug- 
           gests that there may have been confusion between A.IV 
           and AVI.
