     Fol. 1, ‘Thomas Cotton’. 
     Previous ownership: Thomas   Smythe  (ex dono  John 
       Crispe, 1575, fol. 5v); John Smythe (fol. 5v). According 
       to the ownership record on fol. 5v, John Smythe gave 
       the manuscript to Thomas Cotton on 15 July 1631, but 
       he died in 1608 and therefore cannot have been the 
       donor. The manuscript must have been given by his son, 
       Thomas  Smythe, who was created Viscount Strangford 
       in 1628 and whose coat of arms is now pasted on the 
       inside of the front cover. See Complete Peerage, XII, 
       part 1, p. 358; and Davenport, English Heraldic Book- 
       Stamps, p. 347. For the manuscript's fifteenth-century 
       owner, Thomas  Jakes (signature on fols 44, 225 and 
       258, art. 5), see N. Pronay & J. Taylor, Parliamentary 
       Teats of the later Middle Ages (Oxford, 1980), p. 202.
