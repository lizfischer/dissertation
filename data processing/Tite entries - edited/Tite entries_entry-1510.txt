Entries - or the absence of entries - in the early catalogues 
       are not, for the most part, cited for the volumes that 
       follow because, as Appendix volumes, they are a later 
       creation. For those Appendix volumes which have been 
       restored to an Emperor  location, reference should, 
       therefore, be made to the catalogue citations under that 
       entry. However, entries have been found in the early 
      catalogues for Appx XXXIX,  XLI, LVI and Fragments 
       XX,  and  possibly for Appx  XLVII,  L,  LXV  and 
       Fragments IV, VII, VIII and XIV; and because these 
      volumes  bear no other known pressmarks, their cata- 
      logue entries are cited here.
