Thomas  Fortescue manuscript, received by Cotton from 
      Arthur Agarde, in loans 18.9, 71.5 and 111.14. 
    Probably the manuscript Elizabeth Dormer asked to bor- 
      row, 1624 (Jul. C.III, fol. 155). 
    Fols 98-321, art. 7 of this or Nero D.I used by Selden and 
      listed (‘Matthew Paris his liues of the Abbots of S 
      Albons’) as a Cotton  manuscript  in his Historie of 
      Tithes, 1618. Selden’s extract (on p. 329) is from fol. 
      105v of part I of E.TV and from fol. 35 of D.I. In view of 
      the pencil trefoil markings (of a type used by Cotton) 
      against the passage in D.I, it is likely that that manu- 
      script rather than E.IV was Selden's source. 
    Richard James’s excerpts from  this manuscript are  in 
      Bodl., MS James 10 (SC 3847), p. 102. 
    ‘The number ‘261 at the top of fol. 33 (above the second 
      version of the contents-table) is not that for this manu- 
      script in 6018 but for Galba A.XV. 
    It would  seem, from  the composition  of the present 
      volume, that Cotton added to it (as shown, for example, 
      by a comparison of the two contents-tables, on fols 1v 
      and 33, of which the former, which is undoubtedly the 
      later of the two, includes art. 1, while the latter, by 
      Richard James, does not). On the other hand, the notes 
      from art. 7, made in CUL, Ee.3.44, before Cotton received 
      the manuscript, cite folio numbers which indicate that 
      the volume was in its present form at that time.
