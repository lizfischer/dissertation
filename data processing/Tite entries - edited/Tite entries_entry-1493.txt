There are two deleted entries in the contents-table on fol. 
    2 (‘Item Johe< > Belet< > de [?] divinis officiis / Item 
    <>  episcopo < > metrice’), the first of which is also listed 
    in the  contents-table on fol. Iv. The possibility that 
    these may now  be part of Vit. A.X1 is, however, unlikely: 
    for example,  the quire signatures ‘P’ to ‘S’ (probably 
    written by Cotton)  which appear  in the first of these 
    items do not form part of any sequence in Appx. XIII.
