             Catalogues: 36789, fol. 14v; 36682 (art. 1 only). 
             Previous ownership: (of part I (fols 1-190, art. 1)) Thomas 
               Allen, 1622 (Watson, ‘Allen of Oxford’, pp. 289, 310). 
             Previous ownership: (of part II (fols 1-93, artt. 2 and 3)) 
               John  Prise; Jesus College, Oxford (C.J. Fordyce & T.M. 
               Knox,  ‘The library of Jesus College, Oxford’, Oxford 
               Bibliographical Society. Proceedings and  Papers  V 
               (1936-39), (Oxford, 1940), 56, 58; Ker, ‘Prise’, 13 and 
               J.32). Ker (citing Bodl., MS Twyne 22, p. 114) points out 
               that Richard James  showed  Brian Twyne  the manu- 
               script while it was still at Oxford; Fordyce & Knox 
               believe that James may  have been responsible for its 
               removal  from Oxford  but note that it is not known 
               whether  the four printed books once owned by Cotton 
               and  now  in Jesus College library (one of which was 
               given by  him  in 1626) were  compensation   for the 
               alienation of the manuscript. 
             Extracts by James from the manuscript are in Bodl., MS 
               James  23 (SC 3860), p. 88. 
             Entered in a list in 6018, fol. 146v as ‘Tib: D.5. 28°: ‘28’ is 
               Allen’s catalogue number. 
             ‘Otho C11’ is written and deleted at the foot of part II, 
               fol. 1.
