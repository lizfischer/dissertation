Ker was the first scholar to suggest that Galba A.XIV 
                 and fols 3-13 of Nero A.II once formed one manuscript. 
                 Michael Lapidge is not persuaded but B.J. Muir agrees 
                with Ker. See M. Lapidge, ‘Some Latin poems as evidence 
                for the reign of Athelstan’, Anglo-Saxon England, 9 
                 (1981), 61-98, especially 84-86; and A pre-Conquest 
                English Prayer-book, ed. by B.J. Muir (Woodbridge, 
                 1988), pp. ix, xii. 
              Fol. 35y, art. 6 (f), carries a note by Cotton dated 1612. 
              John Selden used a ‘life of St Cuthbert’, listed as a Cotton 
                 manuscript, in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. Selden’s 
                reference (on p. 282) is to‘. . . the life... written by some 
                 Monk  under Hen.  I... so that art. 2 in Claud. D.IV 
                which  is by Reginald (who, however, lived under Henry 
                 ID) is probably his source. Nevertheless, other possibil- 
                ities are artt. 7, 8 of A.IL, or Vit. E.I, Fire Report art 11. 
              A  strew border from a fifteenth-century Flemish manu- 
                script, used by Cotton in Galba A-XVIII, was also used 
                by him on fol. 2 of this manuscript: Watson, D'Ewes, p. 
                 89 n. 254; Brown, ‘Cotton, collector and connoisseur?’, 
                p. 289.
