The unbound  fragments from the Cotton collection are pre- 
               served in three locations, known as the Cotton Case 
               (now bound  as Fragments XXX), the Cotton Box and 
               the Cotton  Portfolio. Hand-written descriptions of 
               them, compiled  by Eric Millar, are kept with the 
               descriptions of the Appendix and bound  Fragments 
               volumes. Millar's descriptions indicate the correct loca- 
               tion (where this has been identified) in the Emperor 
               sequence  and in  the Appendix  volumes  of  these 
               unbound  fragments, and, where possible, record other 
               relevant information. As Millar points out, a few of 
               these fragments were catalogued by Smith in his man- 
               uscript catalogue of the Cotton charters (Bodl., MS 
               Smith 90 (SC 15695), of which Add. MS  38683  is a 
               transcript).
