*  VESPASIAN       FI  Records  and   papers  concerning 
       England and Hungary,  ete., Edward III to Elizabeth I. 
    Catalogue: 36789, fol. 165v (? this). 
    The annotation on fol. 1, ‘Henr 8. Hungary’, is probably by 
      Thomas   Cotton. 
    Fol. 135y, art. 69, annotated by Cotton ‘Book of hand. 
      forain’, perhaps an  indication that this article was 
       intended for Vesp. F.III. 
    Organizational notes by Cotton.
