OTHO    A.XIV Ivo of Chartres, history; ete. 
    Catalogues: 36789, fols 117-17v; 36682. 
    Loan: William Camden,  date unknown  but before 1623 
      (143: Smith art.2 of this, Claud. A-VI, Otho C.VII, Vit. 
      A.III, D.XIII, E.VIII, Vesp. A.XIII or Dom. XII). 
    Extracts in Bodl., MS James 8 (SC 3845), p. 134, were 
      probably taken from  this manuscript, a suggestion I 
      owe to Nigel Ramsay.
