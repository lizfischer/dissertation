ITHO   D.X  Robert Grosseteste, works. 
 Catalogues: no entries. 
 Previous  ownership:  Henry  Savile (Watson,  Savile of 
   Banke,  no. 17). 
 The  manuscript was one of those lent or given by Cotton 
   to Westminster  Abbey  library, probably at much the 
   same  time as John Williams, then dean, was endowing 
    and re-equipping it in 1623: Robinson & James, MSS of 
    Westminster Abbey, pp. 27, 35. Smith, Catalogue, “To 
   the Reader’, p. 24, notes the recovery of the manuscripts 
    after 60 years’ absence. See also Teviotdale, ‘Classified 
    catalogues’, pp. 201, 205 n. 51.  ” 
 Grosseteste manuscripts were the subject of a letter from 
   William  Barlow, bishop of Lincoln, to Cotton in 1609: 
   Jul. CII, fol. 19. 
 Smith  art. 45, originally placed after fol. 149, has been cut 
    out. However, despite Frederic Madden’s statement on 
   the flyleaf of the manuscript (contradicted by that in the 
    Fire Report), this may or may not have pre-dated pub- 
   lication of Smith’s Catalogue. As already noted, the arti- 
    cle is listed there, although it is obviously possible that 
    Smith’s source may have been the manuscript contents- 
   table (which includes the article on fol. 1) rather than 
    the manuscript itself. In Watson's view, the article (his 
   88) was cut out before the time of Smith’s Catalogue.
