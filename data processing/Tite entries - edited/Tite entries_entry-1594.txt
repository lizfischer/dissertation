LONDON,     BRITISH    LIBRARY,    COTTON     CHAR- 
     TER   VIL3  Grant  of Simon  de  St Liz to Sawtry 
     Abbey, ¢.1149. 
   Loan: St Lo Kniveton, by 1615 (16.3). 
   The annotation, ‘1147 xi° Stephanu rex’, may be by Cotton. 
     The numbering, apparently ‘xxxi’, on the dorse is prob- 
     ably by Thomas Smith  and may in fact be ‘xxxiv, the 
     number  given to the charter in Bodl., Smith MS 90 (SC 
     15695), pp. 42-43, his catalogue of Cotton charters. See 
     also Humfrey Wanley’s additions to Smith's Catalogue, 
     done for the Report of 1703 (and reproduced in my 
     edition of the Catalogue). 
   Extracts from this charter are in BL, Stowe MS 528, fol. 
     242, where Cotton's ownership is noted.
