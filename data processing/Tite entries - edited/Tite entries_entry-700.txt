lected by Augustine  Baker, 1637, concerning Tib. E.1. 
    Baker refers to a note then  recently written in the 
    manuscript which gave its author as Johannes Anglicus: 
    see Carley, ‘Royal library’, p. 225 n. 23. (It seems certain 
   that this note survives as fol. 1 of the manuscript. Fol. 1 
    is very badly damaged but sufficient of its text can be 
    read under ultra-violet light to establish that it con- 
   tained some  sort of comparison of Capgrave's text with 
   another: for example, one phrase reads ‘. . . hath which 
    Capgrave hath not viz. . ..) This evidence may therefore 
    indicate that 6018, no. 201 (where, as noted above, 
   Johannes  is entered as author), is more likely to refer to 
   Tib. than to Otho, but the entry for Tib. in 36682 gives 
    Capgrave rather than Johannes as the author. 
 Simonds  D’Ewes  asked to borrow this manuscript or Tib. 
    E.I, 1626 (82.28). 
 Extracts by Richard James are on p. 21 of Bodl., MS James 
    28 (SC 3865, where the source is wrongly cited as Otho 
    B.IX).
