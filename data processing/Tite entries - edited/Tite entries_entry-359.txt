“Mr Colwell, John  Selden, John Speed,  or Augustine 
     Vincent, 1621-22 (2.104, 4.45); Simonds D’Ewes, 1626 
     (82.30: this or Vit. D.II). 
   For the working  out of the complicated history of this 
     manuscript  and its relationship to what became Royal 
     MS  14 C.l, see memorandum    11 and see also Carley, 
     ‘Royal library, pp. 213-18, later further developed in his 
     ‘Rishanger’, pp. 71-102. See also his Libraries of Henry 
     VIII, p. Ixxxiii, H2.1056. 
   The Abbreviatio  chronicorum,  fols 13-98v, art. 3, was 
     used by John Joscelyn in his historical collections in Vit. 
     E.XIV  and  by John  Stow in 1575, and, after Cotton 
     acquired it, by Isaac Casaubon (by 1614), James Ware 
     in 1657,  and  Thomas   Gale:  Matthaei  Parisiensis, 
     monachi  Sancti Albani, historia Anglorum, ed. by F. 
     Madden,  RS, 3 vols (London, 1866-69), III, pp. 153-54, 
     156. Madden  believed that Stow was its owner before 
     Cotton but this is not clear from the source he gives 
     (Harl. MS 545, fol. 186) and this ownership has been 
     questioned by Carley, ‘Rishanger’, p. 88 and n. 42. For 
     Casaubon, see Isaac Casaubon,  Epistolae (Rotterdam, 
     1709), p. 554; for Ware, see Add. MS   4783, fol. 99. 
     Madden's  statement that the manuscript was used  by 
     Gale depends  upon his identification - very probably 
     correct - of an annotation  on  fol. 98v (printed by 
     Madden,  mistakenly, as fol. 946) as in Gale’s hand. 
     Further annotations, probably by Gale, are on fols 101, 
     art. 4, fol. 119, art. 5, fols 176v, 177, art. 6, and fols 188, 
     191 and 193, art. 8.
