* OTHO    CVIII Kirkby’s Inquest; cartulary of Nunkeeling 
       Priory; ete. 
    Catalogue: 36682. 
    Fol. 65, ‘Robert Cot[ton]. 
    Loans: Arthur Agarde, 1612-15 (71.35); St Lo Kniveton, 
       1621 (2.29). 
    Extracts  ‘E Chartulario  de Nunkilling  bound   with 
      Kirkbyes quest Ebor in Sir Robert Cottons library’ are 
      in Bodl., MS Dodsworth 118 (SC 5059), fol. 83, a volume 
      composed  in about 1621. Others are in MS Dodsworth 
      108 (SC 5049), fol. 28v. 
    The   manuscript  is recorded  as missing  in Smith's 
      Catalogue of 1696, although he later corrected this and 
      provided an entry in his own working copy: Bodl., MS 
      Smith  140 (SC 15738), p. 1 of final flyleaves. It seems 
      that the  Commissioners  of 1703  found  a different 
      manuscript  under this pressmark. The present manu- 
      script was damaged  in 1731 and is therefore described 
      in the Fire Report. Planta entered it as missing.
