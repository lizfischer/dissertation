  Catalogues: 36789, fol. 114v (entry probably describes fols 
    55-59y, 66, in artt. 8, 10, of the manuscript); no entry 
     in 36682 but possibly one of the manuscripts noted as 
    either present or missing in the checklist of 1656/7, fol. 2. 
  Loans: (of Harl. MS 6850,  fols 35-63 + perhaps parts of 
    fols 63-85v,  art. 10, of this) ‘Mr Randall’ and ‘Mr 
    Attorney’ Hobart, by 1612-13 (27.2); (of Harl. MS 6850,

                 Montagu,  by 1631 (120.1). 
               Papers in this manuscript were probably those examined 
                 by Gilbert Gerrard  who  later (16 December,  1620) 
                 asked to borrow them: Jul. C.III, fol. 176. 
               Montagu’s undated  letter in Jul. C.II, fol. 268, may refer 
                to this manuscript, together with Tit. E.I and / or Add. 
                 MS  33216,  and may  be  connected with  loans 113.4, 
                 113.5 and 120.1. 
               The volume   contains material in the hands  of Henry
