(259.1). 
   Used by John Selden and listed as a Cotton manuscript in 
     his Historie of Tithes, 1618. Selden’s entry (referring to 
     his text on pp. 52-53) reads: ‘A most ancient copie of 
     the Synod of 742 held under Carloman, bound with a 
     Ms. Ansegisus . . :. That the Synod material was at one 
     time present in this manuscript is apparent from the 
     catalogue entry in 35213. The articles that would have 
     preceded and followed it were subsequently destroyed 
     by fire. 
   This might be  the volume listed at 10.13 but for the 
     description ‘printed’ in the margin there.
