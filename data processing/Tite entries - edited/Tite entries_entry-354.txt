Fol. 3, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus’ 
             Loan:  William Le Neve, 1641 (217.2). 
             The  index on fols 1v-2v, 163-64, is by Richard James and 
                is to fols 52-140, art. 6. The page numbering (‘1-221’) 
              of  fols 52-162, artt. 6 and 7, may also be by him and sug- 
               gests that at some period these articles were separated 
               from  the earlier parts of the manuscript.  If so, this 
               period  of separation may be  reflected in an entry (in 
               36789,  fol. 157) of ‘Beda in folio’ in a list of manuscripts 
               ‘Li] a loose leafe’ (i.e. presumably unbound), an entry 
               which,  if it applies to this manuscript (although other 
               identifications are possible), could well describe the 
               earlier sections of D.III and in particular art. 5. 
             Extracts, marked  as from this manuscript, are in James 
               Ware's  notebook,  Bodl., MS   Rawlinson   B.479  (SC 
               11826), fol. 79v.
