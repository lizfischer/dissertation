1612-15 (47.4: ? this). To call Lambe a borrower may be 
          incorrect (see 47.4 where he clearly has control of the 
          manuscript  there entered). If, as I believe, Cotton did 
          not hold the manuscript after making the loan at 47.4, 
          that to Agarde must pre-date it.
