*VITELLIUS      AVII  Pontifical; Benedictional. 
   Catalogues: 36789, fol. 27 (or less likely fol. 29); 36682. 
    Loan: John Selden, 1641 (225.1). A.VII may well be the 
      ‘Caeremoniale Ecclesiasticum Antiquum:  fol’ (though

ANVIL is quarto), listed on fol. 130v of Bodl., MS Selden 
               supra 111 (SC 52557), a catalogue  of Selden’s library, 
               where it is marked with the letter ‘C’, possibly indicat- 
               ing a loan from Cotton. The wording  of this entry also 
               appears in 36789, fol. 27. For the entry in Selden’s cat- 
               alogue, see D.M. Barratt, ‘The library of John Selden 
               and  its later history, Bodleian  Library  Record,  3 
               (1950-51), 135, 213. Barratt does not, however, identify 
               Selden’s entry as Vit. A-VII.
