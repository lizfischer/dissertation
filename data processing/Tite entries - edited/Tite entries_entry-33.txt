?** JULIUS    D.I Cartulary of Rievaulx Abbey; etc. 
   Catalogues: 6018, nos 277, 368; 36682. 
   Previous ownership: ? William L’Isle (Jul. C.IH, fols 238, 
     240; Harl. MS  7000, fol. 92). The last of these letters 
     from L'Isle to Cotton is dated 1622 and establishes that 
     Cotton had been sent (by hand of ‘Sir Thomas Palmer’) 
     UIsle’s ‘book of Rivall’. However, William Dugdale later 
     listed one Rievaulx  register as belonging to Lisle, 
     although he also entered another as belonging to the

Cottons: Bodl., MS Dugdale  48 (SC 6536), fol. 63v; see 
                  also Davis, MC, nos 811, 812. Timothy Graham,  citing 
                  this evidence, speculates that L'sle’s Rievaulx manu- 
                  script was returned to him  (and is therefore not Jul. 
                  D.1) and was perhaps then presented by him to Francis 
                  or George Manners,  earls of Rutland: ‘L’Isle’s letters to 
                  Cotton’, pp. 362-64, 369. See also MC, no. 813. 
                Used  by Richard  Gascoigne,  1623  (fol. Iv), who  has 
                  annotated fols 7, 19, 26, 5iv, etc. His use, presumably a 
                  loan, may well account for the two entries in 6018. 
               There  are extracts, dated 1622, from this manuscript ‘in 
                  Bibliotheca Cottoniana’ in Bodl., MSS Dodsworth   121 
                  (SC 5062), fol. 118, and Dodsworth 9 (SC 4151), fol. 161 
                  (the latter a copy of the former). 
               The  genealogy, fol. 4, art. 1, is not listed in 6018 or 36682 
                  and was  therefore possibly added  to the manuscript 
                  after Cotton's time. It is, however, entered in Smith's 
                  Catalogue.
