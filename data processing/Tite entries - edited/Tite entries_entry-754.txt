VITELLIUS      B.I ‘Publick Records /  Popes Bulles and 
     Breves  / Originall Instructions and other Letters of 
     State / Antient Histories of the Kingdome / Registers 
     of Religeous [sic] houses. 
   Catalogues: 36789, fol. 165 (? this, if B.I was a volume of 
     transactions between England  and Rome:  see below); 
     36682  (from which  the description above, untypically 
     imprecise  for that catalogue, is taken). These two 
     entries seem unlikely to refer to the same volume but in 
     one of the later catalogues, Bodl., MS Rawlinson D.901 
     (SC 13667), p. 131, the entry repeats that in 36682 and 
     is preceded by ‘Inter: Roman & Angliam’ B.I was, how- 
     ever, recorded as missing in the checklist of 1656/7 
     (36682,  fol. Iv), a list which was probably prepared 
     before the Rawlinson catalogue. 
   Loan: Peter Balle, 1640 (205.1: ‘. . .concerninge Religion 
     from  Hen. 6. downward.  marked  Vitellius B.I’, ? this, 
     but see below). 
   In a letter of 1697 to Sir John Cotton, Thomas Smith listed 
     as missing Vit. B.I and three others (Vit. B-XV-XVID), all 
    of which  he was keen to recover and which he believed 
     related to transactions between England and Rome  in 
    the first and last years of the reign of Henry VIII: Bodl., 
     MS  Smith 59 (SC 15666), p, 265. However, as the early 
     entries in Vit. B.II date from the first months of Henry 
     VIII's reign, it seems doubtful whether Smith was correct 
     in believing that this B.I had ever existed, although in 
    view of the terminal dates in B-XIV he may have been 
     right in stating that B.XV-XVII had been lost. Similarly, 
     despite the listing under the B.I pressmark of a probably 
     different manuscript in 36682 and the specific citation of 
     ‘Vitellius B.I’ in the loan to Balle, there must also be some 
     doubt whether that manuscript had existed. The entry in 
     36682  may in fact have been prepared for what became 
     Cleo. E.I-III: the descriptions of these three manuscripts 
     in the same catalogue and the wording on  their title- 
     pages closely echo the entry for B.I. Furthermore, the 
     loan to Balle may well refer to Cleo. E.III.
