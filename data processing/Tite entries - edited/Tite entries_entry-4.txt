* JULIUS    AVN Chronicle of Peter Langtoft; etc. 
               Catalogues: 6018, no. 23; 36682. 
               Fol. 5, ‘Robertus Cotton’; fol. 6, “Ro: Cotton Bruceus’. 
               Fols 171-87, art. 4 (final two leaves) - art. 10, once 
                 belonged to Royal MS  20 A.II and followed fol. 146 of 
                 that manuscript. It is virtually certain that Cotton was 
                 responsible for the transfer: the heading ‘Sir Pers de 
                 Langtofts Cronicle’ on fol. 11 of 20 A.II is in the same 
                 hand  as  the similar headings  (‘Cronicon  Petri de 
                 Langetofte’) on fols 4 and 58 of A.V, and there is little 
                 doubt that this is Cotton’s hand. By adding  the two 
                 leaves to art. 4 he extended his copy of the chronicle by 
                one year to the death of Edward  I (and truncated it in 
                 20 A.II), as well as including in A.V additional mater- 
                 ial attributed to Langtoft. Royal 20 A.II had been in the 
                 Royal library at the time of the Westminster inventory 
                 of 1542 (its number there, ‘10467, still survives in the 
                 manuscript:  see  Carley, Libraries of  Henry   VIII, 
                 H2.1046)  and must  have been  handled by  Cotton in

situ or returned by him after the transfer was made. No 
      further evidence of this transaction has so far come to 
      light but as A.V once contained binding leaves (now in 
      Royal MS  13 D.I*) from Royal MS 13 D.1 itis likely that 
      the alteration occurred in 1612-15, no doubt with the 
      collaboration of Patrick Young, then Royal librarian:
