Bartholomew  Cotton was incorporated with Henry of 
       Huntingdon,  but the loans  to Bancroft (30.1) and 
       Young (49.22, 134.4) were of the combined manuscript 
       in its present form. In consequence, the bishop of 
       Kilfenora must have been Bernard Adams who held the 
       see (previously long vacant) jointly with Limerick, 
       1606-17. MS James  27, p. 126, makes it clear that he 
       gave manuscripts to Cotton. 
     MS  James  27, pp. 126, 147-48, also have extracts by 
       Richard James   from C.V, as  does MS   James  29 
       (SC3866), p. 11.
