Selden  also used either fols 169-307, art. 7, of this manu- 
                 script or Tib. C.VII in the same work, again noting his 
                 source  (‘Henry  Knighton  Abbot   of  Leicester his 
                 Historie’) as a Cotton manuscript. His extract (on p. 
                 484) differs slightly from the wording of the text in each 
                 manuscript (on fol. 170v of E.III and on fol. 6v of C.VII), 
                 thus making it impossible to state which of the two he 
                 was using. His  earlier extract (on p. 147) does not 
                 appear to have been taken from either manuscript. See 
                 Chronicon Henrici Knighton, ed. by J.R. Lumby, RS, 2 
                 vols (London, 1889, 1895), especially I, pp. 15-16. 
              Augustine  Vincent's reference (‘Knighton Leicestrensis 
                 MS. in bibliotheca Cottoniana, fol. [?]29.b. et sequen), 
                 in his Discoverie of Errours, p. 692, is probably to fol. 
                 177, art. 7, of Claud. E.III or to fols 21v-22 of C.VII. 
              Extracts by Richard  James  in Bodl., MS James  10 (SC 
                 3847), p. 155, are from this manuscript. The annota- 
                 tions on fols 285 and 285v of E.III are by James (and 
                 deal with the power of parliament). There are further 
                 extracts by Brian Twyne in Bodl., MS Twyne 24, pp. 65, 
                 71, 72-74, 77, 79.
