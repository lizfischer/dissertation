APPENDIX     XXVIII   Accounts of the navy and  royal 
      household; etc. 
    The Cotton coat of arms appears on the front and back 
      covers but there is no other evidence that this volume 
     â€˜was ever part of the Cotton library. It is likely that it was 
      transferred from the Royal library in error after the fire 
      of 1731. It is now Royal MS Appendix 89.
