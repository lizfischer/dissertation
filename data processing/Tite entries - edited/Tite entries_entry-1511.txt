Appx  XXVII-LXV   are catalogued in the BL’s ‘Unrevised 
      Descriptions’ of the Cotton Appendix volumes, of which 
      a typescript is kept in the Reading Room of the Depart- 
      ment  of Manuscripts, and this rather than Planta’s 
      Catalogue  should be  consulted for these volumes. 
      Fragments  I-XXIX   (which are bound  volumes) are 
      catalogued in a further typescript list, kept with the 
      ‘Unrevised Descriptions. This list is a transcript of 
      descriptions compiled by Sir George Warner and (for 
      Fragments VIII and the additions to XXIX) Eric Millar. 
      There  is also a collection of unbound fragments (for 
      which see the note following Fragments XXX, below).
