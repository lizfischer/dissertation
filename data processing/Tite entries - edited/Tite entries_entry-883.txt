               Previous ownership: (of fols 1-70, art. 1) ? Henry Savile 
                 (Watson, Savile of Banke, unidentified no. 221a. Savile's 
                 entry is of a chronicle running from Richard I to Henry 
                 V, whereas the chronicle in F.IX finishes in 1439. Never- 
                 theless, the contents of the article correspond to Savile’s 
                 description (‘Chronicon  de  London,  de  nominibus 
                 majorum   praetorum,  et  Vicecomitum...),  but  the 
                 second item in Savile's entry (no. 221b) is no longer in 
                 the volume).

                 Parker (Strongman, John  Parker’s manuscripts’, 17, no. 
                 47. Strongman’s  identification seems very probable, 
                 although A.F. Vossen  had  previously suggested that 
                 these articles were transcribed for Cotton, c.1600: Two 
                Bokes of the Histories of Ireland (Assen, 1963), pp. 93, 96.)
