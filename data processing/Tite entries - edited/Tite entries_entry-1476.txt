and  as Cotton Fragments, see my note, “The Cotton 
       Appendix  and the Cotton Fragments’, The Library, 6th 
       series, 15 (1993), 52-55. Smith catalogued what became 
       Appx  I-XXVI, together with what became Appx XLVI 
       and  XLVIII;  Planta printed  entries for what he 
       described as Appx I-XLV, and for what became Appx 
       XLVI  and  XLVIIIL. For further details see the notes 
       following Appx  XXVI  and  Fragments XXX,   below. 
       There  is some  evidence that a few of the  earlier 
       Appendix  volumes  were  once  pressmarked  under 
       Augustus: Appx XXIV, fol. 1, has ‘Augustus. B 24’, while 
       Appx  VIH, fol. 1 (the first of two folios with the same 
       numbering), and Appx XXI, fol. |, have almost certainly 
       ‘Augustus B:  8’ and ‘Augustus) respectively. These 
       entries are all deleted and there are similar deletions, 
       possibly also of ‘Augustus [? B], in Appx V, VI and VII. 
       The fact that Smith applied the pressmarks Augustus 
       A-G when  he was cataloguing Cotton charters (in Bodl., 
       MS  Smith 90 (SC 15695), pp. 4-16) may explain why 
       these manuscript volumes  were removed  from  that 
       pressmark.
