‘Ligger booke . . . of St Albones . . in y° possession of Mr 
      Thomas   Fortescue, Claud. E.IV does not match  the 
      description of the Fortescue cartulary given to Cotton 
      by Agarde  (18.9, 71.5) or the manuscript lent to Lord 
      William  dealing  with land  he  had  purchased  in 
      Durham   (110.1, 111.14). Either Otho D.III or Tib. EVI 
      would  seem more likely to be the manuscript received 
      from Agarde. Unfortunately, both were badly damaged 
      in the fire of 1731 but each contains material from the 
      home   counties and  may  therefore answer  to  the 
      description in Fortescue’s letters. However, D.III seems 
      to be confined to the south of England and this may 
      make  E.VI the more likely of the two candidates for the 
      loan to Lord William. 
    Extracts, perhaps taken from  this manuscript, are in 
      James  Ware's notebook, Bodl., MS Rawlinson  B.484 
      (SC 11831), fol. 19.
