VITELLIUS     CVI  Cartulary of Meaux Abbey. 
              Catalogues: 6018, no. 303; 36682. 
              Fol. 1, ‘Robertus Cotton’; fol. 2, ‘Robertus Cotton Bruceus’. 
              Loans: William  Camden  (Vesp. F.XIII, no. 326, the evi- 
                 dence for this loan, is an undated letter from Camden 
                to Cotton, but as he refers in it to the ‘now Earle of 
                 Leicester, and his brother Sir Philipp’ it can presumably 
                be dated to between  1618, the date of Robert Sidney's 
                creation as earl, and 1623, the year of Camden's death); 
                Augustine  Vincent, 1621 (Vesp. F.XIII, no. 316). 
              The  first three folio numbers added to the contents-table 
                 (on fol. 1) could well be by Camden. 
              Extracts, made in 1621, are in Bodl., MS Dodsworth 118 
                 (SC 5059), fol. 55.
