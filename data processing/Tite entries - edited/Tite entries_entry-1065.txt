   Loan: Francis Crane, 1670  (270). The manuscript was 
     entered as missing in Smith's Catalogue but noted by 
     him as restored in his annotated copy, Bodl., MS Smith 
     140 (SC 15738): these changes are reflected in the loan 
     entry at 270. The restoration is recorded in the Report

     script on p. 3 of MS Smith 140 and corrects the printed 
     entry in this copy.
