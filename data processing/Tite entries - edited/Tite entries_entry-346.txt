‘Notes upon Sir Ralph de Hengham’ in J. Fortescue, De 
           laudibus legum  Angliae  (London,  1616), citing his 
           source as a Cotton manuscript. The  wording in both 
           manuscripts  is identical so that he may  have used 
           either, although two of the words he prints are under- 
           lined in C.IX. (There  is, however, a heavily erased 
           marginal annotation on the relevant folio in BVI.) 
         He also used fols 104-202, artt. 4-14, of this (and Claud. 
           B.D), listed (Chartular[y]. . . ofthe. Abbey of Abingdon’) 
           as a Cotton manuscript, in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. 
           His extracts on p. 208 make it clear that he consulted 
           both manuscripts (they are taken from fol. 107v in C.IX 
           and fol. 12v in B.VI) but his preference seems to have 
           been to use C.IX: e.g. the (identical) originals of his 
           extracts on pp. 298-99 are underlined  in the former 
           (fol. 141v) but not in the latter (fols 128-28v) as are 
           those on p. 53 (found in C.IX, fol. 116v, and B.VI, fol. 
           49), while the ‘Marginal note in an ancient hand’ (also 
           on p. 53) is present in C.IX, fol. 116y, but not in B.VI. 
         There are  extracts by Richard James  from  either this 
           manuscript  or Claud. B.VI in Bodl., MS James  8 (SC 
           3845), p. 71. MS James 24 (SC 3861), p. 3, has extracts 
           ‘ex majori et antiquiori registro monasterii Abingdon- 
           ensis. collectore Glovero’: of the two Cotton manuscripts, 
           BVI  is the more substantial but C.IX is the older. The 
           collector is presumably Robert Glover. Further extracts, 
           made  in 1638  by William Dugdale,  are in Bodl., MS 
           Dugdale   13 (SC 6503),  pp. 89-90.  Other  extracts, 
           probably made  in 1639, are in Bodl., MS Dodsworth 78 
           (SC 5019), fol. 53. 
         Fol. 207 is a letter of 16 January, 1645/6, from Roger 
           Dodsworth   at York to Simonds D'Ewes  and there are 
           notes  by D’Ewes  on  fols 206-9v, added  to art. 14. 
           D’Ewes’s extracts, made  in 1645, from fols 104-202, 
           artt. 4-14, are in Harl. MS 294, fol. 216 (ex ‘Registro 
           Basset .. . Volumine 327’ (the 6018 number)).

            RS, 2 vols (London, 1858), I, p. xvi, whose references to 
           the early seventeenth-century users of B.VI may, in fact, 
           apply to C.IX.
