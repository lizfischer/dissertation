LONDON,     BRITISH    LIBRARY,     EGERTON     MS 
    2733 Cartulary of Peterborough Abbey. 
  Previous ownership: William Fitzwilliam, who apparently 
    gave the manuscript to Robert Wingfield in 1636 (fol. 
    Iv; Davis, MC, no. 755). 
 This  manuscript  may  be  one of  the ‘3. Book  of 
    Peterborough’, promised to Cotton by Wingfield in 1621 
    (3.15), but see entry for Vesp. E.XXI and references 
    there cited.
