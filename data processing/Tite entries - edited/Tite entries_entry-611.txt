   Catalogues: 35213, fol. 39v, no. 9 (lists material (between 
     Smith  artt. 4 and 5, both destroyed) which was still 
     present in 1618 (see below) but which is absent from 
     subsequent  catalogues: it may therefore either have 
     been removed  subsequently by Cotton or overlooked by 
     later cataloguers; it has not been found elsewhere in his 
     manuscripts, for example in Cleo. E.I); 6018, no. 77; 
     36789, fol. 18; 36682.
