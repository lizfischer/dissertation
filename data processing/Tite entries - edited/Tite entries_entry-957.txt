             Frontier in Medieval Ireland: essays presented to J. F.

            table of Cleo. D.II (‘Annales Hibernie ab Anno. 1264. ad 
             1332’) probably  refers to this article. For a possible 
            explanation, see the entry for D.II. 
          The  quire signatures, particularly in the later part of the 
            manuscript,  indicate considerable revision to its order

            ‘Q), fol. 111 (G’ and ‘R’), fol. 119 (‘H’ and ‘S), fol. 145 
            CL), fol. 155 (‘Y’).
