    Catalogues: 6018, no. 9 (fols 139-44, art. 8, is a contem- 
      porary addition); 36682 (except for fols 139-44). 
    Fol. 2, ‘Robertus Cotton’. 
    Previous ownership:  (of fols 2-61, art. 1) Royal library, 
      Westminster,  and passed to Cotton by Patrick Young, 
      ¢.1616  (134.12: this memorandum     establishes that 
      Cotton detached this article from what is now Royal MS 
      13 A.XXI,  fols 12-150 (where  it must have followed 
      fol. 39), while the manuscript was temporarily in his 
      possession, then returning (at memorandum    134.38) 
      the parts he did not want). Cotton had entered what are 
      now  fols 2-61 in a list of ‘Books I want’, c.1609-12 
      (130.6). See Watson, MLGB   Supp., p. 41; J.P. Carley,

      dissolution libraries: Lincolnshire’, Transactions of the

      Colbarne; William Dethick, c.1612; Jacob Chaloner, from 
      whom   Cotton acquired it, possibly by purchase, c.1616 
      (133, 133.6, 133.11). This may be one of the two books 
      of pedigrees, sometime ‘York Colbrands; listed (in Faust. 
      E.L, fol. 180) as removed by Dethick from the Office of 
      Arms.  (Similar material, owned  by  Colbarne, is in
