  This manuscript  was much  damaged  and  disordered in 
    the fire of 1731. For the identification of the surviving 
    articles, see Ker and Lee. The folio numbers given in 
    Wanley’s Catalogus vary in detail from those set out in 
    the Fire Report of 1732. 
  The fragment  which is now Bodl., MS Rawlinson Q.e.20 
    (SC 15606) was part of this manuscript before the fire: 
    Ker, no. 177, and see also a note with the fragment.
