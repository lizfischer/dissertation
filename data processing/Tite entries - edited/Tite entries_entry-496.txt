the same  manuscript. Although  there are entries for 
         both  manuscripts in 36682,  the descriptions of art. 
         1 (the only article listed there for A-VI) are virtually 
         identical. Galba A.VI was missing when the checklist of 
         1656/7 was drawn up (‘A.6. Liber Antiquus Hymnorum; 
         etc. not there: but in the place, Fragments of a booke of 
         Alfred, in Saxon: very ancient: in two parcels; noted, 
         A.B-), and still missing when both Smith and Planta 
         compiled their catalogues. Smith stated that the manu- 
         script had been moved to another (unspecified) location 
         in the library and Planta suggested its identity with Calig. 
         A.XIV. The  probability is therefore that Calig. AXTV 
         was  moved  temporarily to the  Galba A.VI  location 
         while 36682  was being compiled  and this hypothesis 
         gains some support from the fact that there is only one 
         entry (with similar wording to those in 36682) for such 
         a manuscript  in 36789 (at fol. 65). I am grateful to 
         Elizabeth Teviotdale for a valuable discussion of this 
         problem and for suggesting the identification of no. 274 
         in 6018. For the ‘Fragments of a booke of Alfred’, see 
         Otho A.XII.
