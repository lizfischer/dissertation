*NERO    A.XIII Chronicle of the monastery of Hoorn; Rule 
          of the Friars Minor. 
        Catalogues: 6018, nos 107 (this entry, for Nero A.XV + 
          XVI,  fols 1- 92, has a supplementary  entry in the 
          margin  listing A.XIII, artt. 1 and 2, of which art. 2 is 
          deleted), 108 (artt. 2-19); 36789, fol. 12v; 36682. 
        On  the evidence of the entry at no. 107 in 6018, it is 
          possible that some thought was being given to combin- 
          ing A.XIII (or at least its art. 1) with Nero A.XV + XVI, 
          fols 1-92, although the result would have been a bulky 
          volume. Nevertheless, it is notable that art. 1 was not a 
          part of A.XIII as entered at no. 108 and it was added as 
          an afterthought to the contents-table on fol. 1 of the 
          manuscript.
