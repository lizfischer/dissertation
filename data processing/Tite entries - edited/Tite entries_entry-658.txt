OTHO    CII Flores historiarum; ete. 
               Catalogues: 6018, no. 305; 36789, fol. 23. In 36682 the 
                 entry for C.II is of another manuscript, ‘Registrum 
                 Monasterii Sancti Petri Westmonasterii. There  is no 
                 entry for C.II (or C.IID) in Smith’s Catalogue, both being 
                 recorded as missing (‘Desunt’), but in Smith’s annota- 
                 tions to his working copy of his Catalogue he notes C.1I 
                 as restored and lists its contents (‘Flores Historiarum’,, 
                 etc.) on a flyleaf (Bodl., MS Smith 140 (SC 15738, p. 3). 
                 Later, in the inventory of 1718 (Add. MS  4696), the 
                 ‘Registrum’ reappears but  in David Casley’s annota- 
                 tions, made to Smith’s Catalogue after the Fire, C.II is 
                 described  as the  Flores historiarum  (see Frederic 
                 Madden's annotations to the Fire Report). This confusion 
                 may owe  something to the fact that, according to Smith, 
                 the Flores historiarum formerly belonged to St Peter's, 
                 Westminster  (MS  Smith  140, p. 1; and  see below). 
                 However, it may also be that a Westminster register was 
                 once shelved next to the Flores historiarum, becoming 
                 confused with  C.II and therefore accounting for the 
                 apparent absence of a manuscript under Otho C.III. It 
                 may  also be  relevant that in 1696/7 Smith  was  in 
                 correspondence with Robert Peacock, one of the execu- 
                 tors of Richard Perrincheif (d. 1673), prebendary of 
                 Westminster.  Perrincheif had borrowed  manuscripts 
                 relating to Westminster from the Cotton library, which 
                 Smith was  endeavouring to recover: Bodl., MSS Smith 
                 53 (SC 15660), p. 109, and Smith 65 (SC'15671), pp. 153, 
                 155; see also DNB (under Perrincheif}) and J. Le Neve, 
                 Fasti ecclesiae Anglicanae, ed. by T.D. Hardy, 3 vols 
                 (Oxford, 1854), IIT, p. 361. One of these manuscripts was 
                 Tit. A-VIII; it is possible that Otho C.II may have been 
                 another. See also Bodl., MS Smith 59 (SC 15666), p. 261. 
               Previous ownership: John  Stow, bought by Cotton from 
                 his widow, 1605 (MS Smith  140, p. 1). 
               There are annotations by John Joscelyn on fols 43, 76v, 
                 78, etc. and, according to Madden (note on fol. 40v), by 
                 Matthew   Parker on  fol. 40, etc. E.M.  Thompson, 
                 Chronicon Angliae, RS (London,  1874) maintains (pp. 
                 xiii, xiv, xxviii) that C.II once belonged to Parker.
