OXFORD,     BODLEIAN     LIBRARY,    MS  SMITH    1(SC 
                15608) William Camden, Britannia. (London, 1607).STC 
                4508. 
              First title-page (with map), ‘Robert Cotton’; second title- 
                page, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus’. 
              Loans: Sir William Howard,1635 or 1636 (114.1: ? this); 
                Thomas  Smith, 1690 (Bodl., MS Smith 57 (SC 15664), 
                p. 147). 
              This is a printed copy (but catalogued as a manuscript), 
                with substantial numbers of manuscript annotations by 
                William Camden:  it must have been his working copy 
                and  no doubt was bequeathed to Cotton on Camden's 
                death. The slip pasted to p. 645 is in Cotton’s hand; 
                there are annotations by Richard James on pp. 189, 306 
                and 341, and by Smith on pp. 47, 626, 649, etc. It passed 
                to Thomas Hearne  on Smith's death in 1710 and then to 
                the Bodleian Library, apparently on Hearne’s death in 
                1735: DNB (under Smith); R. DeMolen, ‘The Library of

              A copy of the 1594 edition of Britannia is listed in 35213, 
                fol. 57.
