TIBERIUS    B.VII Chronicle of William Thorne. 
    Catalogue: 36682. 
    Previous ownership: Lord William Howard (2.76: ? this + 
      CUL, Add. MS  3578, or Tib, A-TX). 
    Loan: John Barkham, 1621 (2.76: ? this + CUL, Add. MS 
      3578, or Tib. A.IX). 
    This manuscript has been missing since at least the mid- 
      seventeenth century: see 122.1 (which may date from 
      the late 1630s), 36682, fol. 1 (where it is entered as Aug. 
      B.VII) and Smith, Catalogue. It is possible that it was 
      once combined with CUL,  Add. MS  3578 and  that it 
      was retained by Cotton when that manuscript was lent 
      to Edward Dering. 
    Hanna, â€˜Foxe, 317 and 322 no. 10, has proposed that this 
      manuscript previously formed part of the collection of 
      John Foxe at Magdalen  College, Oxford, then to be 
      handed to Cotton by Richard James in or after 1624. If 
      this proves to be correct, B.VII cannot have been the 
      manuscript lent to Barkham.
