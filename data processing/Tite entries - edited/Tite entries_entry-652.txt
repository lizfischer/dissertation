OTHO    B.XIII Ingulph’s chronicle; etc. 
        Catalogues: 6018, no. 188 (Smith artt. 1 and 2 only); 36682. 
        Previous ownership: William Cecil (Bodl., MS Lat. hist. d. 
          2, fol. 2v. I am grateful to Pamela Selwyn for this 
          identification.). 
        Loans: John  Selden, 1621 (2.69); Henry Elsyng, 1626 
          (Henry  Elsyng, Judicature in Parlement, ed. by E.R. 
          Foster (London and Rio Grande, 1991), p. 75 and n. 5); 
          Selden, 1653 (237.3). 
        Used by Selden and listed (‘Petrus Blesensis his continu- 
          ance of Ingulphus’) as a Cotton manuscript  in his 
          Historie of Tithes, 1618. His extract (on p. 324) is from 
          a part of the manuscript which was destroyed in the fire 
          of 1731: see Rerum Anglicarum  scriptorum veterum, 
          vol. 1, ed. by W. Fulman (Oxford, 1684), p. 119, and the 
          cross-references to Fulman’s work entered in the manu- 
          script by Frederic Madden. See also Peter of Blois, 
          Ingulph’s Chronicle of the Abbey of Croyland, with the 
          Continuations of Peter of Blois, ed. by H.T. Riley 
          (London, 1854), p. 247. B.XIII must also be the Cotton 
          manuscript cited by Selden on p. 8 of his ‘Notes upon 
          Fortescue’, in J. Fortescue, De laudibus legum Angliae 
          (London, 1616) but the manuscript is badly damaged 
          and the source of his extract is no longer to be found. I 
          owe this reference to Selden’s text to Gerald Toomer. 
       Richard  James made extracts from this manuscript in 
          Bodl., MS James 18 (SC 3855), p. 79.
