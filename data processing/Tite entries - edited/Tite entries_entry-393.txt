NERO    A.I Laws and  ecclesiastical institutes. 
   Catalogues: 6018, no. 125; 36682. 
   Fol. 3, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus’. 
   Previous  ownership:  John   Joscelyn, 1580,  William 
     Lambarde,   ? Francis Tate  (an ownership  sequence 
     which differs from that put forward by Ker, Catalogue 
    of Anglo-Saxon MSS,  nos 163, 164, and which is derived 
     from an analysis of the extracts from this manuscript 
     extant in Jul. C.II, qv), Thomas Crompton   (21.4: as 
     Crompton   died  in  1609  his  ownership  probably 
     followed Lambarde’s).  If  loan 23.4  refers to this 
     manuscript rather than (the more likely) Jul. C.II, Tate’s 
     ownership  of A.I would  be established and, in that 
     event, must  have followed  Crompton’s  because  the 
     manuscript at 23.4 was given by Tate. Cotton owned A.I 
     by 1613 (Jul. C.II, fol. 52, and see loans to Howard and 
     Bacon, below). 
   There are annotations by Robert Talbot on fols 71v-74v, 
     art. 9, fol. 86y, art. 12, fol. 127y, art. 41, etc; fols 58-69v, 
     part of art. 8, are in the hand of Joscelyn who also 
     annotates passim; the note on fol. 44v, art. 3, may well 
     be by Tate. 
   Loans: Henry  Howard,   c.1612 (21.4; an undated tran- 
     script of a letter from Howard to Cotton, asking for the 
     loan of books of pre-Conquest  laws, is in Bodl., MS 
     Smith 71 (SC 15677), p. 15); ? Francis Bacon, ? by 1613 
     (23.4: (2) this or (1) Jul. C.1D; Tate, 1612-16 (73.3); 
     Tate, before 1617 (111.8); James Ussher, 1646 or 1647 
     (226.3). There  are  extracts by  Ussher  (from  fols 
     127v-67y, art. 41) in Bodl., MS Rawlinson D.280  (SC 
     15428), fol. *53. 
   Listed by John Selden as a Cotton manuscript and  used 
     by him in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. His extracts (on 
     pp. 196-97) from  the ‘Excerptiones Ecberti’ are from 
     fols 127v-28, art. 41, of A.I; that in the marginal note 
     (on p. 213) is from fol. 87, art. 13; that from ‘an old 
     Exhortation  ... in 8’ (p. 66) has  not been  found. 
     Another extract is on p. 222.
