CLEOPATRA     DVI  Cartulary of John de Macclesfield. 
              Catalogue: 36682. 
              The extracts in Bodl., MS James 24 (SC 3861), pp. 3-4, 
                are almost certainly from D.VI. If so, they indicate that 
                the manuscript came  from, or was connected with, 
                Ralph Starkey. 
             Annexes  3e, 5c.
