     Previous ownership: John Marsham,  who  gave it to the 
       Cotton library (Maidstone, Kent County Archives, Doc. 
       U1121 Z19, fol. 129, no. 3). Fol. 129 of the Maidstone 
       manuscript is a list of ‘Books given to Sir John Cottons 
       Library by John Marsham   Esq. This wording  estab- 
       lishes that the donor was the younger, rather than the 
       elder, John Marsham, as the elder was knighted in 1660 
       and John Cotton did not succeed to the baronetcy until 
       1662. See Teviotdale, ‘Classified catalogues, p. 199. 
    At the top of fol. 2, the first leaf of text, is ‘e w o/. Cf. Appx
