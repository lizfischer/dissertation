OTHO   A.XVI Ecclesiastical constitutions; etc. 
          Catalogue: 36682 (where numbered A.XV). 
          Loan: John Selden (36682, fol. 135v). 
          The omission of Otho A.XV from 36682 accounts for the 
            discrepancy between its numbering of subsequent Otho 
            A. manuscripts and that in Smith's Catalogue.
