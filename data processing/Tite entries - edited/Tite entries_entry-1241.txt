This manuscript was  originally planned as a combined 
     volume with Tit. F.II. Paginated in one sequence, the 
     two were presumably  divided by Cotton. His binding 
     instructions, clearly written at the same time as each 
     other, appear in both volumes. 
   Organizational notes by Cotton. 
   Annexes 4, 5c, 7b.
