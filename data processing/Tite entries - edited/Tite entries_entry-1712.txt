SAN  MARINO,     HENRY   E. HUNTINGTON      LIBRARY, 
          MS  ELL. 1699  Irish version of the Modus  tenendi 
          parliamentum  (the Exemplification of 1419); ete. 
        Loans: James  Ley, 1611, and Thomas  Egerton  (61.3); 
          Robert Bowyer, 1616 (14.3). 
        The manuscript was in Cotton's hands, if not his owner- 
          ship, in 1611 and 1616, and probably reached Egerton 
          from him  (14.3, 61.3). See N. Pronay &  J. Taylor, 
          Parliamentary Texts of the later Middle Ages (Oxford, 
          1990), pp. 117-18, and ‘The manuscripts of the Modus 
          tenendi parliamentum’, English Historical Review, 83 
          (1968), 673-74. I am indebted to Mary L. Robertson, 
          Curator of Manuscripts at the Huntington Library, for 
          assistance with the identification of the loans of this 
          manuscript. See  also Tite, ‘Manuscript records of 
          Parliament’, 132-33.
