JULIUS    D.II Annals and register of St Augustine’s Abbey, 
                 Canterbury. 
               Catalogues: 6018, no. 312; 36682. 
               Previous ownership: John Twyne  (Watson, “Twyne’, 148, 
                 no.15; see also Davis, MC, nos 192 and 200); Thomas 
                 Smythe;  ? Richard James.  Smythe’s ownership  and 
                 James's probable ownership are derived from extracts, 
                 made by the Oxford scholar, Brian Twyne (John Twyne’s 
                 grandson), in Bodl., MS Twyne 22, p. 407. These extracts 
                 must surely have been made  while Jul. D.II was still 
                 combined with Add. MS  46352 because their heading, 
                 ‘Liber MS qui dicitur Matricula Thomae de Thanet. . 2, 
                 is reminiscent of the wording (‘Matricula de camera 
                 abbatis sancti augustini . . ”) on what was once the title- 
                 page of the combined manuscript but which, since its 
                 division, has become fol. 94 of the Add. MS. Brian 
                Twyne   notes in the margin against his heading, ‘Mr 
                 Rich: James  of C.C.C. Oxon  a thick book in 4°..? 
                 (a description which would  best suit the combined 
                 manuscript), and  records that his grandfather had 
                given the book to Smythe in 1580. The manuscript was 
                 divided before the Jul. section was entered in 6018 and 
                 it must be likely that Cotton was responsible for the sep- 
                 aration. The Add. MS section passed to Edward Dering, 
                 presumably also from  Cotton. The quire signatures, 
                 reflecting the present arrangement of both volumes, 
                 may  be by Cotton; however, they  do not form  one 
                sequence (Jul: ‘A’ to ‘G.G’; Add. MS: ‘K’ to ‘B.B’) and the 
                Add.  MS  series indicates that material, perhaps sup- 
                plied at the time of the division, has since been lost. 
              Loans: Augustine Vincent, before or in 1621 (Vesp. F_XIII,

                Bradshaw,  1621 (2.71; see also Jul. C.III, fols 79, 80).
