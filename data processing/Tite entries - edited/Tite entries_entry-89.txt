AUGUSTUS      Lii.110 Plan of fortifications at Coevorden. 
           Previous ownership: John Peyton, 1612 (Galba E.I, fols 
             363-64y,  art. 149). In this letter to Cotton from The 
             Hague, Peyton stated that he considered the plan to be 
            ‘in such scale as I coulde guesse most apte for your 
             booke’. He offered to secure other plans for Cotton and, 
             in return, asked for support to advance his career.
