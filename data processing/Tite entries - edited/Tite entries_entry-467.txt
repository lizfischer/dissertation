     Previous ownership: ? Henry  Savile (Watson, Savile of 
       Banke, no. 21); John Stow (signature on fol. 161 and 
       probably (erased) on fol. 2). Stow has annotated fols 9,

    This  manuscript  may  possibly be  item  Y in  Robert  _ 
       Glover's list of books, a suggestion I owe to Pamela 
       Selwyn: BL, Lansdowne  MS  58, fol. 105. 
    Loan:  William  Watts, by 1640  (see the preface to his 
       edition of Matthew  Paris, Historia major (London, 
       1640), for which the manuscript was used). 
    The  two sections of art. 2, divided at fol. 162, were prob- 
       ably bound together by Cotton: see Matthaei Parisiensis, 
       monachi  Sancti Albani, historia Anglorum, ed. by F. 
       Madden,  RS, 3 vols (London, 1866-69), I, p. Ixiii. As 
       identified by Madden, the note on fol. 1* is in Thomas 
       Gale’s hand.
