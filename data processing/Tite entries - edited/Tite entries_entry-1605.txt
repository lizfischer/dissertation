grateful to Jayne Ringrose for this information and for 
    drawing the manuscript to my attention. 
  In a letter to Edward Bernard of 1694, Thomas Smith 
    looks forward to finding out whether a manuscript of 
    Fortescue, held by a Mr Worseby  who  had  recently 
    taken up residence in one of the Inns of Court, was 
    from the  Cotton library: Bodl., MS Smith  57  (SC 
    15664), p. 423.
