  Previous ownership: (of at least art. 1, fols 3-168v) ? John 
    Stow. (In his Remaines William Camden used a copy of 
    Robert  of Gloucester’s work ‘in the Librarie of the 
    industrious Antiquary maister John  Stowe’ and  the 
    additions on fol. 164v of A.XI are in Stow’s hand; but 
   there is also a transcript of Robert by Stow in the archives 
    of the Merchant Taylor's Company: see Remaines of a 
    Greater Worke, concerning Britaine, ed. by R.D. Dunn 
    (Toronto, 1984), p. 94, a reference I owe to Gerald 
    Toomer.)
