manuscript is in Cotton's hand. The reference to fol. 29v 
       is entered on fols 1 and lv of A.II, while a note referring 
       to the A.II text on fol. 29v (‘Capite 32’) is included in 
       the 6018 entry for D.IV. For further information on this 
       matter, together with other new and detailed evidence 
       on D.IV, see M.P. Brown, The Lindisfarne Gospels: soci- 
       ety, spirituality and  the  scribe (London:   British 
       Library, 2003), pp. 128, 137-38.  Brown  argues  that 
       these references establish that, rather than receiving a 
       book known  to have associations with Durham, Cotton 
       believed he had worked this out for himself.
