* NERO   A-XV  Chronicle of Ely, part I. 
        Catalogues: 6018, nos 107 (joint entry with Nero A.XVI, 
          fols 1-92; see also Nero A.XIII), 331; 36789, fol. 4v; 
          36682. 
        Fol. 1, ‘Robertus Cotton Bruceus’. 
        Loans:  Richard Bancroft, 1608, by hand  of Zachariah 
          Pasfeild (29.21: (1) this + fols 1-92, art. 1, of Nero A.XVI, 
          Tit. A.I or Dom. XV, or (2) Otho E.V); Peter Balle, 1651 
          (127: this, Tib. A-VI, Claud. C.XI, Nero A.XVI, Vesp. 
          A.XIX, Tit. A.I or Dom. XV). 
        Name:  ‘John Langley’ (fol. 133). This may be the man who 
          was  appointed  high  master of  the college school, 
          Gloucester, in 1617 and high master of St Paul’s School 
          in 1640, Langley’s signature of 1653 in Add. MS 4273A, 
          art. 1, is not, however, identical with that in the manu- 
          script. The name on fol. 133 is likely to have been added 
          after the chronicle was divided (see below). 
        ‘The two entries in 6018 (nos 107 and 331 + 332) establish 
          that the chronicle was divided by Cotton in the early 
          1620s: the entries for nos 331 and 332 cannot have been 
          made  earlier than 1623 as no. 326, Nero D.VII, was 
          given to the library in that year. 
        This or Nero  A.XVI, Tit. A.I or Dom. XV  may  be the 
          chronicle of Ely which  Francis Tate suggested in a
