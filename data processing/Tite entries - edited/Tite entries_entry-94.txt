* AUGUSTUS     II Charters; ete. 
    Catalogue: 36682 contains a heading but no entries. 
    Loan: Le Neve, 1641 (217.1). The borrowing seems almost 
      certainly to be of the Saxon charters which, in the 
      seventeenth century, were pasted into a portfolio. It is, 
       nevertheless, interesting (in the light of Le Neve's 
      borrowing)  that this same material was  refused to 
       Humfrey Wanley  when  he asked to borrow it in 1697. 
       Previously, Simonds Dâ€™Ewes  had received a similar 
       rebuff when he asked for the loan of what was probably 
       the same  volume.   For these  episodes, see Tite, 
       Manuscript Library, pp. 26, 29.
