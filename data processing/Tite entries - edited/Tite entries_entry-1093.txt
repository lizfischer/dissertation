      10v. The extracts by Richard James from this manu- 
      script, now in Bodl., MS James 8 (SC 3845), p. 103, 
      must have been made while it was in the hands of either 
      Richard  or Edward  Sackville. Other extracts, made 
      while it was owned by Edward Bysshe, are in Bodl., MS 
      Dodsworth  55 (SC 4197), fol. 57.
