VITELLIUS      B.XIV Records  and  papers concerning 
     England  and Rome, 1527-39. 
   Catalogues: 36789, fol. 165 (? this); 36682. 
   On  fol. 208v, art. 24, Cotton has noted ‘Spayn to be put 
     with the papers of Spay [sic] at London’, presumably 
     an  indication that he was away from London  when 
     making  this annotation. 
   Organizational notes by Cotton.
