* VESPASIAN     A.I Psalter; etc. 
  Catalogues: 35213, fol. 39, no. 3 (? this), and fol. 43v (fol. 
    43v has two entries for psalters: this, Tib. C.VI or Vit. 
    E.XVIID;  6018, no. 88; 36789, fol. 156v, no. 18 (? this 
    or Cleo. B.XIV); 36682 (the manuscript was moved  to 
    A.I from a previous position as A.XXI, where its entry 
    in 36682 has been deleted; the checklist of 1656/7, fol. 
    1y, records the transfer: ‘A.21. blotted in the Catalogue, 
    because remooved  to A.1. and there found. That which 
    formerly was A.1. (the Contents whereof are in a loose 
    sheete:) is wanting.). 
  Fol. 12, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus / 1599”. It is most unlikely that 
    Cotton would have used the form ‘Bruceus’ before 1603, 
    so that this entry was almost certainly backdated: Tite, 
    Manuscript Library, p. 6 n. 7. 
  Previous ownership: William Cecil (BL, Lansdowne  MS 
    8, art. 73; The Vespasian Psalter, ed. by D.H. Wright 
    (Copenhagen, 1967), p. 36). 
  Loan: James Ussher, 1625, one of four psalters borrowed 
    Gul. C.III, fol. 383). For his collation, see Bodl., MS 
    Add. A.91 (SC 27719), fol. 111. 
  It has been suggested that fol. 160v was taken from what 
    is now Cambridge, St John’s College, MS H.13. As three 
    other leaves elsewhere in Cottonian manuscripts may 
    well have come from the same source, it is possible that 
    Cotton was responsible for the transfers: see O. Pacht, 
    The Master of Mary of Burgundy  (London,  1948), pp. 
    64, 69, and Wright, cited above, pp. 33-34; also Tite, 
   ‘Lost or stolen or strayed’, p. 296 n. 37. 
 For  the charter of  King  Ethelbald, bound  with  this 
    manuscript in Richard James's time (and now probably 
   Aug, II.3), see Smith, Catalogue, ‘History and Synopsis’, 
   pp- 49-50 (where the psalter is also discussed), and Ker, 
    Catalogue of Anglo-Saxon MSS, no. 203.
