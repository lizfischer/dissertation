GALBA   A-XIX  Proverbs of King Alfred. 
               Catalogues: no entries. 
               Previous ownership: Richard Lateware, Thomas  Allen, 
                 1622 (Watson, ‘Allen of Oxford’, pp. 290, 309). 
               Almost certainly the manuscript recorded by Richard 
                 James as ‘proverbia Elfredi quae habet Cottoniana ex 
                 dono Th. Allen’ in Bodl., MS James 18 (SC 3855), p. 28. 
               John Spelman used a (lost) transcript of this manuscript, 
                 given to him by Thomas Cotton: see his Life of Aelfred 
                 the Great (Oxford, 1709), pp. 125-31, and H.P. South, 
                 The Proverbs of Alfred (New York, 1931), especially pp. 
                 7-9. | am grateful to Michelle Brown for assistance in 
                 identifying Spelman’s reference.
