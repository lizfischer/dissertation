Keynes, 118, 120) carries Allen’s name with the date 
           1613 and  it is now followed, on  fols 35-94 of the 
           Bodleian  manuscript, by quite different (Wycliffite) 
           material which, however, was also once owned by Allen. 
           This association suggests that these folios must almost 
           certainly have travelled together from the  time of 
           Allen’s ownership, as the likelihood of their being 
           reunited after a period of separation would sgem to be 
           small. In that case, either fols 35-94 went to Cotton at 
           the same time as fol. 34 and the remainder of Otho A.I, 
           whereupon  fol. 34 was detached from A.I (perhaps in 
           the course of its rearrangement that the catalogues 
           reveal - see below) and added to fols 35-94, or fol. 34 
           never went to Cotton but was joined with fols 35-94 in 
           Allen’s hands. There are supporting  arguments  for 
           either possibility as both men were in the habit of re- 
           arranging manuscripts and James Ussher, a post-Allen 
           owner of fols 35-94, received other Wycliffite material 
           from Cotton. However,  the probability is that Cotton 
           never received these folios with A.I from Allen, for they 
           are listed in Allen’s 1622 catalogue while Otho A.I is 
           not. Moreover, we know that Cotton had been hoping 
           to acquire A.1 from Allen in the previous year (see 3.12).

         The order of items set out in 36789 and 36682  differs 
           from that in Smith, Catalogue. Keynes, ‘Cotton MS. Otho 
           A.D, 122-23, has therefore pointed out that it would 
           appear that the  Regula pastoralis was moved  from 
           second place in the manuscript in the 1620s to the end 
           by the time of Smith’s Catalogue entry. If this transfer 
           did indeed take place in the 1620s (as is most likely), 
           the entries in 36789 and 36682 must have been copied 
           from an unaltered contents-table (no longer surviving 
           in the manuscript)  rather than  from  the (altered) 
           manuscript.
