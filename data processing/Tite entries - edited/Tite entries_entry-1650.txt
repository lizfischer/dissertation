LONDON,    BRITISH    LIBRARY,    ROYAL   MS  5 B.XV 
     Fulcherus Carnotensis, Historia Hierysolymitana; etc. 
   This may well be the manuscript which Cotton apparently 
     borrowed from, and then returned to, Patrick Young, 
     Â¢.1616 (49.21). Although it bears no marks of use by 
     Cotton, it  is the  only  copy  of  the  Historia 
     Hierysolymitana now in the Royal Library. It has a 
     lengthy note by John Joscelyn on fol. 134.
