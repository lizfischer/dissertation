   Previous ownership: (of fols 1-28, Smith art. 2) ? Henry 
     Savile (Watson, Savile of Banke,  no. 226); (of fols 
     29-54, Smith artt. 3 and 4) Savile (Watson, no. 144); (of 
     fols 55-64, Smith artt. 7-10) Savile (Watson, no. 155). 
   Fols 65-102, Smith art.14, probably the source cited as a 
     Cotton manuscript  by John  Selden on p. 272 of his 
     Historie of Tithes, 1618.   " 
   The manuscript was one of those lent or given by Cotton 
     to Westminster Abbey  library, probably at much the 
     same time as John Williams, then dean, was endowing 
     and re-equipping it in 1623: Robinson & James, MSS of 
     Westminster Abbey, pp. 27, 34, 52. Smith, Catalogue, 
     “To the Reader’, p. 24, notes the recovery of the manu- 
     scripts after 60 years’ absence. It is therefore unlikely to 
     have been the manuscript  Simonds  D’Ewes  asked to 
     borrow in 1626 (82.24). See also Teviotdale, ‘Classified 
     catalogues’, pp. 201, 205 n. 51. 
   There are annotations by Cotton on, e.g., fols 26, 29, 52v,
