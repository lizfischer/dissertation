     The value to Cotton of the collections in Vit. C.XI and XVI 
       is exemplified by a draft paper in his hand at the end of 
       C.XVI  (fols 539-40v, art. 24), which deals with pro- 
       posals for the marriage of Charles, prince of Wales, and 
       draws on earlier marriage negotiations. It was prepared 
       for presentation to the king in 1615. See Sharpe, Cotton, 
       pp. 131-34.
