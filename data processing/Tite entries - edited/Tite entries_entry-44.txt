JULIUS   E.I Records of Gascony and Aquitaine, Henry II 
          to Edward II. 
        Catalogue: 36682. A  note in the archives of the BL’s 
          Department   of Manuscripts (the ‘Cotton Catalogue 
          Box’) suggests that this volume might be no. 131 in 6018 
          but there is nothing to confirm this identification. 
        This is almost certainly the manuscript sent, with others, 
          to Cotton by Richard James: Harl. MS 7002, fol. 122, 
          an undated letter written no earlier than 1622 (because 
          it is addressed to Cotton at his Westminster house) and 
          probably  dating from shortly before the time when 
          James  became Cotton’s librarian, ¢.1625. 
        Loans: William Greene, 1639 (189.2); Godfrey Goodman, 
           1655 (256). 
       Extracts by  Richard James in Bodl., MS James  10 (SC 
           3847), p. 35. 
        Annexes  2b, 3b.
