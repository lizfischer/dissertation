           Fortescue, De dominio politico et regali; etc. 
         Catalogues: 36789, fols 151v-52v; 36682. 
         Fol. 115, art. 14, ‘Ro: Cotton Bruceus’; fol. 175, art. 21, 
           ‘Robert Cotton Bruceus’. 
         Much  of fols 85-1411y, artt. 11-19, is in the hand of Thomas 
           Talbot. 
         Loans:  Henry  Montagu,   by 1631  (113.10: ? this); ? 
           Montagu,  by 1631 (120.5: ? this); Sir William Howard, 
           1640 (196.1). 
         Fol. 82, art. 9, is there recorded as a transcript from a 
           manuscript  formerly owned  by Peter Mostyn. Henry 
           Spelman  (Concilia, 2 vols (London, 1639, 1664), I, pp. 
           108-9) published  his own transcript in 1639, stating 
           that he believed the original had been transferred to the 
          Cotton library. It has, however, yet to be found. I owe 
           this information to Nigel Ramsay. 
         Extracts, marked as from this manuscript, are in James 
           Ware's  notebook, Bodl., MS   Rawlinson  B.479  (SC

           Dodsworth  78 (SC 5019), fols 13, 21v, etc., were proba-
