This may have been one of the John Brompton manuscripts 
      that William Watts returned to Selden (cf. loan 208.4, 
      above) in November 1640, having despaired of produc- 
      ing an edition because of the troubled times: see J.A.F. 
      Bekkers, Correspondence of John Morris with Johannes 
      de Laet (1634-1649) (Assen, 1970), letter no. 22, a refer- 
      ence and suggestion I owe to Gerald Toomer. Selden had 
      some  control over the Cotton library during the 1640s. 
    Extracts by Richard James are in Bodl., MS James 10 (SC 
      3847), p. 95, where the source is wrongly stated as Tib. 
      C.XVI,  a manuscript that does not exist. There are 
      further extracts by Brian Twyne in Bodl., MS Twyne 24,
