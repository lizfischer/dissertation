The  volume  consists largely of the collections of George 
       Carew  (d. 1629): many articles are either in his hand 
       (e.g. fols 77-80, artt. 63-64) or annotated by him (e.g. 
       fol. 60, art. 55, fol. 83v, art. 65). Fol. 63, art. 57, is in 
       William Camden's  hand. 
    The  Ormond   papers  in B.XI apparently came  into the 
       Exchequer  of the Receipt after the death in 1539 of 
       Thomas   Boleyn, earl of Ormond  and  Wiltshire; they 
       were divided in the reign of Elizabeth, the bulk of them 
       eventually being added to the records of Chancery in 
       the Rolls Chapel. It has been suggested  that Cotton 
       abstracted them from one or other of these two reposi- 
       tories: see D. B. Quinn, â€˜Ormond Papers, 1480-1535", in 
       Calendar of Ormond   Deeds,  ed. by E. Curtis, 6 vols 
       (Dublin, 1932-43), IV, pp. 307-8. I owe this reference 
       to Nigel Ramsay.
