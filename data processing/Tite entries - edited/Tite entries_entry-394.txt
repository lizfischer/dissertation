* NERO    A.II Theological tracts; life and miracles of St 
     Cuthbert; ete. 
   Catalogues: 6018, no. 111; 36789, fol. 156, no. 8; 36682. 
   Fol. 3, ‘Ro: Cotton’. The heavily cropped signature at the 
     foot of fol. 14 may also be Cotton's. 
   Fols 38, 40, 40v, art. 6(i), annotations by Robert Talbot. 
   Fols 3-13, artt. 1-5, are probably detached leaves of Galba 
     A.XIV. As both manuscripts carry annotations by John 
     Joscelyn, several in A.II being related by him to the year 
     1593 (Ker, Catalogue of Anglo-Saxon MSS,  no. 157), it 
     is likely that Cotton was responsible for the separation.
