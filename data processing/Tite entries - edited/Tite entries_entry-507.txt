ALBA   A.XV  Thomas  Rudborne, annals of Winchester. 
 Catalogues: 6018, no. 261; 36682. The checklist of 1656/7 
   has the entry under Galba: ‘A. 14. 15. there, but of neces- 
   sitie transposed, (as elsewhere sometimes) because 
   of the roome’ (36682, fol. 1v). Claud. E.IV, which is 
   not entered in 6018, carries the number ‘261’ above a 
   contents-table by Richard James on fol. 33, but no 
   connection with A.XV is apparent. 
 For the possibility that this was the copy of Rudborne’s 
   chronicle owned by William Darrell and John Twyne, 
   and listed by John Joscelyn in Nero C.II, fol. 212, see 
   Watson, “Twyne’, 140 and 147, and Roberts & Watson, 
   Dee, p. 19 n. 15. 
 According to Frederic Madden (note in Appx LXI, fol. 1), 
   Planta catalogued and misdescribed under the A.XV 
   pressmark what is now Appx LXI.
