OXFORD,       BODLEIAN       LIBRARY,      MS    LAUD 
    MISC.   509  (SC 942) Hexateuch;  Ailfric, homily on 
    Judges. 
  Catalogue: 6018, no. 81. 
  Previous ownership: Royal library, Westminster (and once 
    part of a manuscript of which the remainder is Vesp. 
    D.XXI,  fols 18-40:  Ker, Catalogue of Anglo-Saxon 
    MSS,  no. 344; Carley, ‘Royal library’, p. 219 and n. 64; 
    Carley, Libraries of Henry VIIT, H2.622). 
  Loans: Francis Tate, by 1612 (22.11: this or Claud. B.IV); 
    William  Lisle, 1621 (2.38, 4.35 or 4.37; see also Jul. 
    C.IIL, fols 240, 242-44); L'Isle (6018, no. 81). 
  Ker’s statement that loan 2.38 was the occasion of the 
    manuscript’s loss from the Cotton library is incorrect: 
    there are extracts by  Richard James,  made  in the 
    context of notes from  other Cotton manuscripts, in 
    Bodl., MS James 18 (SC 3855), p. 66, and James did not 
    enter Cotton's service until about 1625: see Tite, ‘Lost 
    or stolen or strayed’, pp. 265-66. Furthermore, Timothy 
    Graham,   in a discussion of the movements   of this 
    manuscript  (and of Claud. B.IV) during Cotton’s own- 
    ership and of L'Isle’s work on both, has established that 
    Lisle borrowed  the manuscript from Cotton again in 
    1625: ‘Early modern users of Claud. B.IV, pp. 287-93; 
    and his ‘L'Isle’s letters to Cotton’, p. 374, where he also 
    notes that the manuscript was still in L'Isle’s hands in
