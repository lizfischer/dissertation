* OTHO    D.I Chronicles; ete. 
   Catalogues: 35213, fol. 43v; 6018, no. 214; 36789, fols 
     145v-46 (and fol. 95: ? this or ? Cleo. C.II]); 36682. 
   Previous ownership: (of fols 32-195, Smith art. 4) ? Prince 
     Henry / ? Royal library, if this (or Royal MS 14 C.XIII) 
     is the manuscript listed by Cotton as one of the ‘Books 
     I want’, c.1609-12 (130.14); (of fols 222-38, Smith artt. 
     7-10) ‘[Laurence]  Nouelli 1563’ (fol. 238v, read by 
     ultra-violet light). 
   Loan:  ‘Mr  Hall’, Henry  Fanshaw’s  servant, 1621-22 
     (2.105, 4.14). On grounds of size, this loan cannot be

identified with Cotton’s other manuscript of Tewkesbury 
                 annals, Cleo. A.VII, a small quarto volume on vellum 
                 (and itself probably the manuscript lent at 2.107). The 
                 list in Otho D.I, a folio manuscript, of the founders of 
                 Tewkesbury  Abbey  was destroyed in the fire of 1731 
                 when other parts of the manuscript were damaged. The 
                 list may have been a late insertion in Otho (it is not 
                 mentioned  in 6018 and it is perhaps the item entered, 
                 on its own, in 36789, fol. 95 (unless this is Cleo. C.III, 
                 fols 210-28, art. 12) and, with the remainder of Otho, 
                 on fol. 146); it was recorded at the end of Smith's 
                 Catalogue entry, although he says that it followed his 
                 art. 2; and it may have been written on paper (Report 
                 of 1703). It (or Cleo. C.IIT) is therefore likely to have 
                 been the ‘litle paper book of Tewkesbury’ which Cotton 
                 undoubtedly possessed and  which Augustine  Vincent 
                 (according to an undated letter: Vesp. F.XIII, no. 322) 
                 was unable to borrow as it was already out on loan. As 
                 Vincent did borrow a Tewkesbury manuscript (at 2.107, 
                 which, as already stated, is probably Cleo. A.VII) and at 
                 the same time as 2.105 was out on loan, this increases 
                 the chances that 2.105 is both the ‘litle paper book’ and 
                 the article in Otho D.I. However, there is an extract 
                 (though with minor  verbal differences), which could 
                 have  been  taken  from  Cleo.  C.III, in Vincent's 
                 Discoverie of Errours, p. 612. 
               Simonds  D’Ewes asked  to borrow either (1) this manu- 
                 script, Jul. E.VII or Nero D.VIIL, or (2) Cleo. D.IV, 1626 
                 (82.24). See also entry for Otho C.XVI.
