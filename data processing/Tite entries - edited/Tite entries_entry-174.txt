    The text of the manuscript was printed by Roger Twysden 
       in his Historiae Anglicanae scriptores decem (London, 
       1652). In ‘Lectori’, sig. 3.A, he records Selden’s help in 
      securing borrowings  from the Cotton library. 
    Binding leaves in Royal MS 13 D.I*. 
    Sharpe,  Cotton, p. 51, is incorrect in stating that this 
      manuscript  came  into the library after Cotton’s death.
