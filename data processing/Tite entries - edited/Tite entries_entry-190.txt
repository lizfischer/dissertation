          Loans: Lord William  Howard  and Nicholas Roscarrock, 
            1607 or later to 1612-16 (20.1, 74.4: this or Otho D.IX); 
            ? John Laughton, ? c.1634 (137.2). 
          Lord  William Howard   wrote to Cotton in 1621 (Vesp. 
            F.XIII, no. 318) asking to borrow his manuscript of 
            Johannes Anglicus; the implication of the letter is that 
            neither he nor  Roscarrock had  previously seen the 
            manuscript. The only mention of Johannes Anglicus in 
            the catalogue entries listed above is in 6018, no. 201, 
            where  his authorship is noted as an addition to the 
            entry. This (unhappily slender) piece of evidence may 
            therefore suggest that the manuscript borrowed in loan 
            20.1 (‘Capgrave Legenda Angliae  Foll.) was no. 208. 
            The situation is, however, complicated by the fact that 
            Roscarrock,  like Cotton,  thought  that the  Nova 
            Legenda  Anglie, the borrowing at 20.1, was written by 
            Capgrave and  supposed that Johannes Anglicus (now 
            known  to have been John of Tynemouth, the real author 
            of the Nova Legenda) was  the same man.  (I owe this 
            information  about Roscarrock  to  Nicholas Orme.) 
            Additional evidence is offered by Oxford, Jesus College 
            MS  77, fols 63-64v, which contains information col- 
            lected by Augustine Baker, 1637, concerning Tib. E.1. 
            Baker  refers to a note then recently written in the 
            manuscript which gave its author as Johannes Anglicus: 
            see Carley, ‘Royal library’, p. 225 n. 23. (It seems certain 
            that this note survives as fol. 1 of the manuscript. Fol. 1 
            is very badly damaged  but sufficient of its text can 
            be read under  ultra-violet light to establish that it 
            contained some sort of comparison of Capgrave's text 
            with another: for example, one phrase reads ‘... hath 
            which Capgrave  hath not viz...) This evidence may 
            therefore indicate that 6018, no. 201 (where, as noted 
            above, Johannes is entered as author), is more likely to 
            refer to Tib. than to Otho, but the entry for Tib. in 
            36682  gives Capgrave rather than  Johannes  as the 
            author. 
          Simonds D’Ewes  asked to borrow either this manuscript 
            or Otho D.IX, 1626 (82.28).
