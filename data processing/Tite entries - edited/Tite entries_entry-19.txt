JULIUS    B.IX Register of Thomas  Goodrich, 1551-53. 
              Catalogues: 36789, fol. 162v; 36682. 
              Previous  ownership: John  Wye   (fol. 1v); Thomas Wye 
                (fols 1, Iv); “Robart Beles Booke’ (fol. 1), probably the 
                Elizabethan  diplomat of that name. (Beale’s signature 
                varies: cf. those in Add. MSS 48018, fol. i, and 48024, 
                fol. xiv’. I am grateful to Patricia Basing for her advice 
                on this matter.)
