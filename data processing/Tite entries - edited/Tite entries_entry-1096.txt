      Selden and listed (‘The ancientest Book of Ely’) as a 
      Cotton manuscript in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. He 
      printed no extracts from the manuscript he was using 
      but cited it (p. 412) as ‘the most especiall moniment 
      [sic] that is extant, for the holding of Pleas in the Saxon 
      times. The ‘old Book of Ely, apparently belonging to 
      Cotton and temporarily perhaps in James Ussher’s pos- 
      session, which Selden asked to borrow in 1625, may also
