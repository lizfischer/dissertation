(21.11, 52.6: this or Claud. E.III); John Selden, 1621, 
      and Augustine  Vincent (2.68); William Dugdale, 1639 
      (183.1: this or Claud. E.III; extracts by Dugdale, dated 
      1639, probably from C.VII, are in Bodl., MS Dugdale 6 
      (SC 6496), p. 497). 
    This or Claud. E.III used by Selden  and listed (‘Henry 
      Knighton  Abbot  of Leicester his Historie’) as a Cotton 
      manuscript  in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. His extract 
      (on p. 484) differs slightly from the wording of the text 
      in each manuscript (on fol. 6v of C.VII and on fol. 170v 
      of E.II1), thus making it impossible to state which of the 
      manuscripts he was using. His earlier extract (on p. 147) 
      does not appear to have been taken from either manu- 
      script. See Chronicon Henrici  Knighton,  ed. by J.R. 
      Lumby,  Rolls Series 92, 2 vols (London, 1889, 1895), 
      especially I, pp. 15-16. 
    Augustine  Vincent's reference (‘Knighton Leicestrensis 
      MS. in bibliotheca Cottoniana, fol. [?]29.b. et sequen.’), 
      in his Discoverie of Errours, p. 692, is probably to fols 
      21v-22 of C.VII or to fol. 177 of Claud. E.III. 
    William Burton requested a loan of this or Claud. E.ITT in 
      1627: Jul. C.III, fol. 51. 
    Extracts in Bodl., MS Dodsworth  63 (SC 5005), fol. 140, 
      and in James  Ware's  notebooks, Add.  MS  4793, fols 
      81-83v, and Bodl., MS Rawlinson B.484  (SC 11831), fol. 
      36v, may be from either this manuscript or Claud. E.III.
