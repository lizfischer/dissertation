LONDON,     LAMBETH     PALACE,   MSS  53, 54 Nicholas 
      Harpsfield, Historia Anglicana ecclesiastica. 
    Previous ownership: Lord Lumley (MS 53, fol. 5; MS 54, 
      fol. 1. See also Jayne & Johnson, Lumley Library, no. 
      1344); ? Prince Henry, c.1609-12 (130.16). 
    The signatures indicate that the work was in two volumes 
      in Lumley’s time. This must therefore have been the 
      copy of Harpsfield that Cotton listed in “Books I want’, 
      ¢.1609-12 (130.16), where two volumes are specified. 
      The binding of the volumes together in their present 
      form probably occurred in Archbishop Sancroft’s time: 
      MLR. James, A Descriptive Catalogue of the Manuscripts 
      in the Library of Lambeth  Palace. The mediaeval 
      manuscripts (Cambridge, 1932). The volumes were in 
      Archbishop  Bancroft’s hands before  his death in 
      November  1610 as they are listed in his catalogue, now 
      Lambeth  Palace, Library Records F.1, fol. 69. 
    There are annotations throughout both volumes (e.g. MS 
      53, fols 174v-75; MS 54, fol. 9) in a hand very similar 
      to, but probably not, that of Patrick Young. 
    I am very grateful to Dr Richard Palmer, Librarian of 
      Lambeth  Palace Library, for being permitted to exam- 
      ine these volumes.

             Catalogue: 36789, fol. 13v (? this and / or ? Otho E.X). 
             Fol. 61, ‘Ro: Cotton’; fol. 150, ‘Ro: Cotton’; fol. 159, 
               ‘Robertus Cotton’. 
             Loan: Henry  Montagu,  1621 (2.25: ? this). 
             Possibly among the manuscripts that Robert Sidney asked 
               to borrow in 1623 and which Cotton had previously told 
               him  were on  loan to the Lord President (perhaps an 
               error for the Lord Treasurer, the borrower at 2.25): Jul. 
               C.II, fol. 364. 
             The  endorsement   on fol. 152v, art. 8, is probably by 
               William  Cecil. The annotation on fol. 158v, art. 10, and 
               the additions to the text on fol. 323, art. 29, are by 
               Henry  Howard.  Fols 132, 140-41y, part of art. 6, fols 
               245-47v, art. 18, fol. 316, art. 26, fols 332-36, art. 34, 
               are in the hand of Ralph Starkey. 
             This volume  has many   organizational notes by Cotton, 
               together with his binding instructions (on fol. 338v). 
             Annexes  7b, 8e. 
             I am grateful to the Librarian of the Society of Antiquaries 
               for permitting me to examine this volume.
