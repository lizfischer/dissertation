AUGUSTUS  I Maps, charts, ete.

The  modern   arrangement,  largely set out in Planta’s 
    Catalogue, divides Aug. I into two parts, 1.i consisting 
    of 86 numbered  items and L.ii having 117 items (both as 
    in Planta), together with a Supplement of 21 items (not 
    listed by Planta). However,  Smith's brief Catalogue 
    entry for Aug.  I, which he described as a ‘volumen 
    vegrandis molis, makes no  such division and specifies 
    only seven items, although it is clear that at least three 
    are descriptions of multiple items. According to the 
    Report  of 1703, the ‘codex’ then contained 105 folios 
    and  an index. There is a numbering  on  some  items 
    which   post-dates Smith’s Catalogue  and  pre-dates 
    Planta’s (e.g., Aug. Lii22  (‘TAJugustus. 1-116’), 23 
    (Augustus. I. 115°), 25 (Augustus I. 119’), 26 (Augustus 
    ~— 1-120’) and 28 (‘Augustus: I. 117’)), and this series was 
    apparently  in existence before 1707  when  William 
    Watkins  scrutinised (at least part of) Augustus I, noting 
    the numbering  on 1.i.47 (Augustus. I. 29’ and ‘Augustus. 
    1. 30’), 49 (Augustus I. 31. 32’) and 55 (Augustus I. 36, 
    37, 38, 39’). There are two numbers from some  other 
    series on Li.13. 
  The  material in Aug. I bears little evidence of Cotton's 
    ownership  or, indeed, of previous ownership. In the 
    entries which follow, therefore, only those items are listed 
    where  immediate  pre-Cottonian ownership  or a cata- 
    logue or loan record can be established. Unfortunately, 
    only in the case of one of the few surviving records 
    (43.1) of loans of maps   is the wording  sufficiently 
    specific to make it possible to establish which maps 
    were being borrowed or where they had come from: two 
    other records (2.16, 2.80) refer to a clearly important 
    book  of printed maps which, sadly, has yet to be identi- 
    fied. However, one or two observations may be made on 
    the sources of Cotton’s acquisitions. Janet Backhouse 
    (Sir Robert  Cotton's record of a royal bookshelf’, in 
    Wright, Cotton as Collector, pp. 235 and 237 n. 24) has 
    noted  that the 1547 inventory of King  Henry VIII's 
    goods and chattels records that in ‘the litel Study called 
    the  newe  Librarye’ there were ‘uppon  two  Shelues 
    paternes for Castles and engynnes of warre’ (Harl. MS 
     1419A, fol. 187), and comments that there are drawings 
    and  designs of this type in Augustus. It is therefore 
    possible that Cotton obtained some  of his maps and 
    charts from the Royal collections. In addition, in their 
    discussion of the interaction between the collection of 
    maps  at Hatfield House and  the acquisitions of other 
    collectors, Skelton & Summerson   observed (Maps  at 
    Hatfield House, pp. 10, 16, 20) that many of the items 
     in Augustus I must once have belonged to William Cecil 
    or to his son, Robert, or both. Again, precision is diffi- 
    cult to achieve but timing may be less so. The death of 
     Robert Cecil in 1612 provided Thomas Wilson, Keeper 
    of State Papers, with a major opportunity to repossess 
    papers which had been lost in previous decades (Skelton 
    &  Summerson,   p. 15) and it is more than likely that 
    Cotton, too, was able to benefit from this event. (I owe

this observation and much advice on the subject of the 
                 Augustus  maps to Peter Barber.) Furthermore, Skelton 
                 &  Summerson   (p. 16 and n. 8) pointed to Aug. Lii.41 
                 (noted ‘John Dunstall pincit. 1612’) as evidence that 
                 Cotton  employed  copyists, this plan of Carrickfergus 
                 having been  taken from a now  lost original drawn in 
                 about 1567. But while the date may be significant, no 
                 firm proof of such a practice has yet emerged, although 
                 the possibility may well gain credence from Cotton's 
                 habit of  commissioning  transcripts of state paper 
                 material.
