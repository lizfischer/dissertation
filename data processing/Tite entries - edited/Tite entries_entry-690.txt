      to 6018, no. 306). 
    Selden used either fols 49-97v, Smith art. 7, of this manu- 
      script or Claud. E.III in his Historie of Tithes, 1618, 
      noting his source (‘Radulphus de Diceto’) as a Cotton 
      manuscript. His extract (on pp. 388-89) is to be found 
      on fol. 83v of D.VII, a manuscript badly damaged in the 
      fire of 1731, and on fol. 126v of E.III. For the similari- 
     ties between the texts in the two manuscripts see W. 
     Stubbs, Radulfi de Diceto . . . opera historica, RS, 2 vols 
      (London, 1876), I, p. xcii. Selden’s extract is found in II,
