    Catalogues: 6018, no. 320; 36789,  fols 39-43; 36682 
      (very partial entry). 
    Loans: Richard  Bancroft, 1608, by hand of John  Pory 
      (29.2: (1) this or (2) Vit. E.XIV); Pory, ? by 1612 (25.9: 
      (2) this or (1) Vit. E.XIV; William Camden, 1617 (6.4); 
      James Ussher, 1621 (2.12: this or Vesp. A.IX). 
    This was probably the manuscript used by John  Selden 
      and listed (‘A Book full of late collections out of some 
      Saxon  and Latin  Moniments  of this Kingdom,  in a 
      large 4’) as a Cotton manuscript  in his Historie of 
      Tithes, 1618. His extract on p. 227 is from fol. 125, 
      Smith art. 57, of D.VII; those on pp. 225 and 226 have 
      not been  found  in D.VII (a damaged   manuscript), 
      although the latter may have been taken from Smith
