              Catalogues: 6018, no. 8; 36789, fol. 157, no. 33 (? this, Jul. 
                 BYVII, Tib. C.II, III or Otho B.XI); 36682. 
               Previous ownership: (of fols 111-82, art. 6) ‘Mr Savell gave 
                 me this book in Trinitie terme . . 1569’ (fol. 111), pre- 
                 sumably the Savile who was later provost of Eton. 
              There  are annotations by John Joscelyn on  fols 31v, 78, 
                 79y, etc., art. 1, and fols 107v-8v, 110-10y, art. 5. These 
                 annotations suggest that the first five articles came to 
                 Cotton as a unit. See also Ker, Catalogue of Anglo-Saxon 
                 MSS,  nos  188 and  205,  and  D.M.  Dumville,  ‘The 
                 Anglian collection of royal genealogies and regnal lists’,

                 1976), 25. 
               Ker, no. 205, suggests that the number ‘58’ on fol. 1, prob- 
                 ably an inventory number, was written by Joscelyn.
