he was also using (and from which he inserted extracts 
                  into A.XI on fols 75 and 81). On p. 206 of the Historie 
                  of Tithes the extract he prints from the text (‘In Bibl. 
                  Cotton. &  apud V.C. Tho. Allen. Oxon.)  is probably 
                  taken  from  the Allen  manuscript: the  wording  is 
                  similar to, but not identical with, that on fol. 80 of AXI 
                  (nevertheless annotated by him “Tithad [sic]’). Other 
                  detailed cross-references noted by him in the margins 
                  of A.X1 link up with further sources which he made use 
                  of in the Historie, pp. 204-10.

                  manuscript, are in James Ware's notebook, Bodl., MS
