CLAUDIUS      D.NII Chronicles; ete. 
  Catalogues: 6018, nos 328, 385; 36789, fol. 93 (? this); 
    36682. 
  Fol. 5, ‘Robertus Cotton Bruceus’. 
  Previous ownership: ‘Johannes Eborac:’ (John Piers, fol. 5); 
    Henry Savile (Watson, Savile of Banke, no. 20; loan 2.57.) 
  Loan: Lord William Howard,  1621 (2.57). The two entries

    appears to have noted it against no. 328 in 6018. The 
    note of (no doubt  the same) loan against the entry 
    in Savile's catalogue (Watson, no. 20) is in Cotton's 
    hand. There are marginalia by Howard on fols 10, 24v,
