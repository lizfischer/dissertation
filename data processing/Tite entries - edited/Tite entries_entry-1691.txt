LONDON,      WESTMINSTER        ABBEY:    Robinson  & 
          James, MSS  of Westminster Abbey, List B, no. 163; no 
          entry in CMA. Commonplaces  of divinity. 
        See headnote, above. 
        Perhaps the octavo manuscript listed to be delivered to 
          Patrick Young, c.1616 (49.37, 134.33), although the 
          description in List B is of a quarto manuscript: ‘Certain 
          Commonplaces   of Divinitie scholastically translated. 
          Also diverse Sermons. Latine. 4°. The manuscript in 
          List B may be the same as CMA, no. 1303 (‘An English 
          Manuscript of Divinity’), although Robinson & James 
          (List C, no. 213) did not think so.
