Smith  in his own  copy of his Catalogue, Bodl., MS 
     Smith  140 (SC 15738), slip following p. 4. 
   Previous ownership: (of parts of the manuscript) Henry 
     Savile; ‘Ex dono Johannis  Anstis Armigeri’ (fol. 2). 
     Watson,  Savile of Banke, no. 283 and p. 90 n. 283.1, 
    suggests that Anstis may be an ancestor of the John 
     Anstis (born 1669) who became  Garter King of Arms, 
     but as he also points out the Anstis family came from 
     Cornwall  whereas Henry  Savile was a Yorkshireman. 
     Whatever  the order of ownership, it is almost certain 
     that it was Anstis, Garter, who held the manuscript 
     before it entered the Cotton library: he was one of the 
     commissioners  of 1703; the manuscript’s absence from 
     any  of the seventeenth-century catalogues may well 
     indicate a late accession; and Smith’s entry in MS Smith 
     140 reads: ‘Contents of a MS book given by Mr Anstis’. 
   For names in the manuscript, see Watson, no. 283. 
   The  numeral  ‘XXXI’  on fols Iv and  2 is a number 
     allotted to this manuscript by Humfrey Wanley  and 
     used in his manuscript additions to Smith’s Catalogue,
