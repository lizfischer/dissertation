This  or the Christ Church  manuscript  used  by John 
          Selden  and listed (‘Chartular[y] ... of the Abbey of 
          Osney’) as a Cotton manuscript in his Historie of Tithes, 
          1618. Despite Selden’s fairly extensive refereffces (on 
          pp. 306-8, 357, 397-402), they do not appear to reflect 
          sufficiently precisely the content and order in either 
          manuscript  to make it possible to determine which of 
          the two was  his source. It is, in fact, not impossible 
          that he used both, as both were probably in Cotton's 
          possession when Selden was preparing his book. 
        Transcripts from this manuscript, made by Arthur Agarde 
          in 1596 (as recorded in Dodsworth  39, fol. 97v, when 
          E.XV was  in Steward’s possession), may be the item lent 
          (and  possibly lost) at 44.6. Other extracts, probably 
          made  in 1639, are  in Bodl., MS Dodsworth   78 (SC 
          5019), fol. 117v.
