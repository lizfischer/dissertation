                             Turs comedy  of humours apparently failed on presentation, an event difficult to under- 
                             stand when  it is read today along with its more successful contemporaries. 
                                In 1693, James Knapton issued a collection of seventeen of Shadwell’s plays made up 
                             from  separate editions, not all firsts, with a general-titlef. That collection was adver- 
                             tised in June 1693 (Arber T.C. 11.468), and copies are in the Dyce  and C.W.Clark 
                             libraries. Another copy was in the Vickery sale (1933, Lot 632). Sets occur, e.g. the 
                             Gosse, without the general-title.
