                 Red  morocco, Janseniste, by Canape.  834 x 634 inches. The Shakespeare Library (II, 1918, Lot

               Ture    are three editions dated 1703, all printed on wretched paper. They are paginary 
               reprints of the 1695 edition but there seems to be little evidence by which their order 
               may  be  deduced  except that of progressive corruption. A list of variant readings by 
               which  two  may  be distinguished is given in Bartlett and Pollard Census p.12. The 
               present has  the readings of the so-called “Barnardo’ edition (from the spelling in the 
               last line of recto B) except for sheet M which has the reading or the other or ‘“Bornardo’ 
               edition. However,  a comparison  shows  that this is a distinct edition from either the 
               ‘Barnardo’  or ‘Bornado’ settings. 
                  The note To  the Reader  is as follows: “This Play being too long to be conveniently 
                Acted, such places as might be least prejudicial to the Plot or Sense, are left out upon 
               the Stage: but that we may  no way  wrong the incomparable  Author, are here incerted 
                [sic] according to the Original Copy with this Mark‘. 
                  The copyright in this play has been traced by Mr. Farr Trans. III (1923) pp-253-260.
