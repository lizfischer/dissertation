                            PROVENANCE:   Given by Lady  Evelyn to William Upcott and by him  to John Dillon at whose

                          difcourfes printed at Paris 1660. 

                          Transcripr:  S* During  my [‘fojourne’ deleted] aboade at Paris, I did continually wish 
                          for your company, for The particular aduantage which I should haue gain’d by ¥ Con- 
                          verfation: but at prefent I alfo wish you here for the publiqz Interest, and for the 
                          benefit which that Affembly (of which I lately difcourf’d to you) might haue made of it. 
                             I haue in my former letters aduertif’d you that Mons: de Montmor* hauing don me 
                          the honour  to cémunicate to me the defigne which he had  to invite a certaine felect 
                          number  of choice Perfons to [‘entertaine him with’ deleted] reafon concerning Naturall 
                           Questions, experiments, and curious Inventions, he impof’d vpon  me the  charge of 
                          projecting [‘the manner’ deleted] an expedient how fuch Conferences  might best be 
                           mannag’d for the publiqz benefit, as well as for the divertiffement of thofe which should 
                           be prefent at ¥ difcourfes. Vpon this I prepard (together wth Mons! du Prat) certaine 
                           Articles w°h were prefented to the very first Affembly, & which indeede was compof’d 
                           of a good nomber of very curious perfons: They were there examin’d with fome  con- 
                           testation of their part who refuf’d to write: And here I tranfmitt them to you, fince 
                           you defire them, and should be glad they might be feene of all the World; becaufe they 
                           are a teftimony of our good intention, and may happly [‘ferue’ deleted] be fervicable 
                           to thofe that would apply themfelues to the fame Recherches which wee  propof’d to 
                           ourfelues: The Iron Age will not allways laft, Peace will oneday vifite the world [‘after’ 
                           deleted] when her turne comes; The Mufes shall not be eternaly profcrib’d, The Arts 
                           will haue a Refurrection, The Sciences reafume their places, and fome [‘more benigne’

                           that thofe Illustrious Perfons instruct vs by their returne [sic], that in fpight of y* 
                           barbarity in the middft of which we  haue hithertoo liued there is yet remaining a 
                           fufficient number of gallant men, who haue  difcouerd their constant affection to y 
                           ftudy of Philofophy, & who are not to be blamed, that (in purfuite of the admirable 
                           introductions & attempts, which thofe whom I nam’d haue made)  things haue hitertoo 
                           [sic] aduanc’d no further towards the vniverfall aduancement of Knowledge: And when 
                           I shall haue named to you a part of thofe that compofe our Affembly, you will confent 
                           wth me, that it would proue  a difficult thing to make vp fuch another though  one 
                           should choofe them amongst  all the curious perfons out of Paris, and perhapps out of 

                            the whole  Kingdome  befides: But it will be better to giue you first a fight of what you

                           them.” 

                                Notes:  1 Samuel  de  Sorbiere (1615-1670), French writer and scientist, translator of More’s 
                                     Utopia and editor of Hobbes and Gassendi. 
                                   2 Sorbiere’s friendship with the author of the Leviathan was alluded to by Evelyn as one of the 
                                     Frenchman’s failings in a letter Evelyn wrote to Dr. Sprat concerning Sorbiere, 31 October 
                                    1664  (Diary and Correspondence I11,1854,p.144).

                                  4 Henri-Louis  Habert  de Montmort,   at whose house  the French  academy   here described 
                                    began  their meetings on the 18th December 1657. 
                                   5 Marin Mersenne,  the friend of Descartes. 
                                   6 Oceuores de Gassendi, Lyons, 1658. 
                                  7 Neither  Sprat, Birch, nor Weld, the historians of the Royal Society, make any mention of 
                                    such an  order. This omission may have been deliberate for Sorbiere, not only through his 
                                    friendship with Hobbes,  but particularly for his disrespect to the Society in his Relation 
                                    d'un  Voyage en Angleterre 1663, and his tactless references to Evelyn’s friend and patron, 
                                     Clarendon, was later not highly regarded either by the Society as a whole or by Evelyn 
                                    in particular, cf. Evelyn’s letter to Sprat cited above.
