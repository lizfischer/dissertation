Tus speech was printed, together with Baconâ€™s speeches on the Post Nati and on the 
Union of the Laws of the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, in a collection, dated 
1641, by Richard Badger for Samuel Brown, being licensed by a committee of the 
House of Commons the 15th May of that year and registered the 29th May. From the 
fact that this separate printing bears no note concerning that licensing, it is possible 
that it was printed prior to the collected edition. 
The G.W.Steeves-Roland Redmond copy has an engraved frontispiece portrait of 
Bacon which does not occur in any other copy we have traced.
