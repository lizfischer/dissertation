                           WuEN  Pepys  saw this comedy of intrigue he thought it ‘the best ... that ever I saw, 
                          or think ever shall’. It was one of the greatest successes of the new theaters though the 
                          author’s sole production and, in fact, little more than a workmanlike translation, made 
                          at the suggestion of Charles II, of Los Empevios de Seis Horas formerly attributed to 
                           Calderon, and now to Antonio  Coello.
