LETTERS OF JOHN LOCKE TO ANTHONY COLLINS 
OarTEs, 1703-1704. 

Most of these letters were reprinted, somewhat carelessly and with excisions and 
modernizations, in Maizeaux’s Collection of Several pieces of John Locke 1720 [q.v., 
and copies are in British Museum Addit. MS.4290. This series at one time included at 
least fifteen letters which are now lacking for the manuscripts here preserved are num- 
bered in chronological sequence in an early handi, possibly that of Collins himself. The 
highest number which appears, and probably the final one of the series for it is found 
on a letter ‘to be deliverd after my decease’, is ‘35’. The numbers lacking are: 1-4, 13, 
15, 16, 18-21, 28, and 31-33. Most of the missing letters were printed in the Collection 
1720. This volume was in the Alfred Morrison library and was bound uniformly and 
sold (IV, 1919, Lot 2943) together with a collection of letters from William and Thomas 
Molyneux to Locke (q.v.]. Seventeen of these present letters are calendared in A.W. 
Thibaudeau’s folio Catalogue of the collection of autograph letters of Alfred Morrison II, 
1888, pp.185-188, and there lettered in chronological order ‘a-p’. Twenty holograph 
letterst, seals removed, tipped into a large folio volume, 15 x 1134 inches, green 
morocco, by Goupil.

The extraordinary tirade against booksellers and bookbinders, see Plate No.XXVII,

with his publisher were always amiable, so much so that Locke appointed Churchill one 
of the executors of his will.

Morrison (folio) Cat, II1, 189, the latter complete so far as it goes. The letter continues: 
“Heads of familyes must be forborne till they please, & if a wife or a child uses importuntie 
or the assistance of the law to get from them, what they have their hand & seal for, the 
father complains of disrespect & injury, a breach of affection is made where it should be 
studiously avoided; & the foolish world usually joyns in with their censures to widen & 
keep open the breach. To prevent this I think there should be noe such transactions as 
borrowing or lending between such persons or securities passed from a father to a son 
but in cases that are absolutely necessary. In all other cases where it is at a mans choise 
to put out his money upon security as he thinks fit, let him take such security as he can 
upon any occasion make use of, & let the hand & seale he has for his money be of such 
a man as he can without restraint produce and urge upon him when there is need, to 
what purpose else is hand & seale? If I use them not I have not my owne when I need 
it; & if I use them 1 loose my quiet & reputation & perhaps my father. But I have dwelt 
too long upon this matter, the fatall consequences I have seen of such things in the 
disturbance of familyes & the ill effects it has had, has made me very carefull to prevent 
it In one that I wish well to. [Continues with last paragraph as printed in Collection)’.

§This was one of Locke's first works and was published at Gouda, 1689, in octavo. It was translated by 
Popple the same year and published in London, in quarto, Locke wrote two other letters in English.

LETTERS TO JOHN LOCKE 

FROM WILLIAM AND THOMAS MOLYNEUX 
Dus.in, 1692-1698. 

Wituiam Motynevx (1656-1698) of Dublin was not only a friend of Locke but also a 
helpful critic of his philosophical works. With the exception of one visit which Moly- 
neux made in 1698, their intercourse was entirely by correspondence and the whole 
of that correspondence which Locke received is here preserved together with several of 
the letters of William’s younger brother, Thomas (1661-1733), whom Locke had met 
earlier in Holland. The first letter, 27th August 1692, was written in reply to one by 
Locke expressing pleasure at the commendation of his Essay on the Human Under- 
standing which Molyneux had included in the Dedicatory Epistle to his Dioptrica Nova 
1692; and the last, 26th November 1698, is an acknowledgment by Thomas Molyneux 
of Locke’s consolatory letter (printed in Dudlin University Magazine XVIII, 1841, 751) 
on the death of his brother. 
These letters, together with the corresponding replies of Locke, were printedta in 
1708 in a collection, Some familiar letters between Mr. Locke and several of his friends 
{q-v.], which was reprinted in Locke’s Works III, 1714, and succeeding editions. They 
are of considerable interest to students of the development of Locke’s philosophical 
works but they also contain interesting comments on Sir Richard Blackmore, Leibnitz, 
Le Clerc, and others. ‘The story of the Latin translation of Locke’s Essay on Human 
Understanding, which William Molyneux undertook to have done first by a Mr. Mul- 
lart and later by a Mr. Burridge, is set forth with considerable detail. See also No.6o1. 
These letters were formerly in the Alfred Morrison collection (IV, 1919, Lot 2943). 
Following a roughly chronological order, they are tipped-in a large folio volume (15 x 
114 inches), bound uniformly with the volume [q.v.] containing the letters of Locke to 
Anthony Collins, green morocco by Goupil. The forty letters of William and Thomas 
Molyneux are numbered twice in an early hand. One series is in red ink and runs, with- 
out any particular chronological order from 1 to 42 with the omission of numbers 6, 
8, 19, 28-30, and the repetition of numbers 3, 11, 27, and 34. The other series, which 
apparently once included Locke's part of this correspondence, is in strictly chrono- 
logical order except that the letters of Thomas Molyneux are placed at the end. In the 
following list these numbers are recorded, the ones in red ink first and the others second. 

taThe printer's marks may still be seen, Numerous passages, none of any moment, mostly personal or 
polite expressions, were deleted.
