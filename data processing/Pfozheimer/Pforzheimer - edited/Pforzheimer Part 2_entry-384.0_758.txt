Charles Greene, and are to be fold | by Nicolas Fuffell at the figne of the white | Lyon 
in Pauls Church-yard. | 1638. |’. Some copies of this play were issued with a Latin 
dedication in some cases addressed to William Ball and in others to Benedict Roberts. 
These dedications are apparently not peculiar to the original or cancel title and are in 
each case an insertion. They probably were not issued with many copies. 
The present issue was evidently intended for inclusion in Nabbes’s Playes, Maskes 
1639, but copies may have been issued separately.
