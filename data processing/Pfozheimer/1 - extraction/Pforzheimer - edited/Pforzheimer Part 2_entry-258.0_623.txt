‘Tus volume contains what perhaps may be called a ‘satire’ in prose upon the sins 
personified by the seven devils sent forth by Lucifer, with particular reference to the 
evidences of their contemporary activity and shows the rising interest in the literary 
‘character’ as a mode. It is said that Shakespeare resented the omission of mention of 
himself in the account in this book of the author’s literary friends, p.s7, and quotes 
derisively from it in several of his plays. On p.62 is a reference which is doubtless to 
the Ur-Hamlet. 
‘The present has been called the author’s most effective non-narrative prose work, 
but Alice Walker, though she admits (R.E.S. VIII, 1932, 272-7) the interest and vigor, 
has shown that it is none the less, in a large measure a mosaic of extracts compiled from 
numerous sources, many of which she has specified. 
One of the Bodleian copies reads in the first line of the title ‘WILS MISERIE’. This 
typographical error was probably quickly corrected for no other copy having it can be 
traced. However, that is by no means a conclusive argument for altogether only twelve 
copies can be located, viz. British Museum (Grenville; another, imperfect), Bodleian 
(three copies, one being the Pearson-Malone), Trinity College Cambridge (Capell), 
Huntington (Farmer-Huth), Harvard (White), Folger, Harmsworth (Freeling), the 
Britwell copy now at the Rosenbach Company, and the present. The Inglis copy 
(resold Sotheby’s 1904 and 1913, and Anderson’s 1918) cannot be traced unless it be 
the Folger.
