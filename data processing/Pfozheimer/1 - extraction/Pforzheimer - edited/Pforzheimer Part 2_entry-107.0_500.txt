‘Tue Certaine Tractates was originally printed in 1618 with title having imprint: ‘Lon- 
don | Printed for Henrie Fetherstone. | 1618. |’. That first edition was appended to the 
present 1616-7 edition of the Polity—no separate copy has been traced even though it 
has separate signatures and pagination. Evidently fewer copies of it were printed than 
of the Polity for in 1622 the present second edition was printed and appended. Later, 
when the present edition of the Polity was exhausted, it was reprinted by Stansby with 
the date 1622. 
The several treatises which were collected under the title, the Certaine Tractates, had 
all been separately published at Oxford but, apparently on the death of Joseph Barnes 
his son sold the rights to Featherstone who by 1622 relinquished them to Stansby. 
There is no record of these transfers in the Registers but in 1639 Stansby’s widow 
presumably included that volume in the books she transferred to Bishop.
