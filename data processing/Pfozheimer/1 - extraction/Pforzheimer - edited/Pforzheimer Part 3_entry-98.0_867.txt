Or  these ten tragedies, seven are known in earlier separate editionsft. Of the others 
              the Thedais, translated by the editor of this volume, was presumably prepared for this 
              publication, while of the two others, the Hippolytus, translated by John Studeley (2), 
              was entered to Henry  Denham   (1566-7, Arber 1.336) and transferred to Richard Jones 
              and  John Charlewood   (1579, Arber 11.359); and the Hercules Oetaeus, translated by 
              Thomas   Nuce§, was  also entered to Denhamta  (1566, Arber 1.327). 
                It is not now possible to determine what arrangements, if any, Marshe, the publisher 
              of the present, made with the several owners of the copyright of the separately pub- 
              lished tragedies. Probably, if he paid them anything it was not very much for they do 
              not appear to have been very popular, and, in any case, he did not apparently acquire 
              the rights for more than this one printingta. 
                 For the most  part, the text here printed is merely a reprinting of the separate 
              editions but in one instance, the Oedipus of Neville, the text is entirely revised and 
              improved  (M.L.R.  IV, 437 and XV,  359), probably by Neville himself. 
                The  influence of Seneca  upon  the Elizabethan  drama  has been  traced, among 
              others, by Professors Cunliffe, F.L.Lucas, and Kastner and  Charlton. There is not 
              much  that can here be added except to say that it was probably greater than even the 
              numerous  identifiable pilferings and paraphrases would seem to indicate. Besides the 
              unquestionable responsibility for the five-act division of the modern European tragedy, 
              it is perhaps not exaggerating to claim for Seneca that the development of blank verse 
              as a vehicle of the English drama, instead of the old fourteener or the heroic couplet, 
              received considerable support from its being obviously the nearest equivalent to the 
              solemnity and weight of the Senecan iambic. That not only the “Tragedy of Blood’ but 
              its concomitant, Elizabethan bombast and stichomythia, are Senecal, and that perhaps 
              the most  important and  certainly most pervading influence of Seneca was upon the 
              ‘thought’ {ta of the Elizabethans. 
                As to whether this influence was exerted directly or through these translations would 
              be difficult to determine, and indeed must have varied considerably with the different 

                  HfFive of the seven are in this collection. 
                  §The entry, which  also includes the Octavia, states that both ‘tragides’ were translated ‘oute of the laten 
                    into englesshe by T W  fellowe of Pembrek  Hall in Chambryge’. The  “T W’ is almost certainly an error 
                    for TN   , not, however, by Arber for Collier (Exéracts p.147) gives the same reading. Thomas Nuce (or 
                    Newce)  according to Venn  (Alumni  cantabrigiensis ILI p.246) was a Fellow of Pembroke, 1562, and his 
                    Octaxia was published  by Denham,  without date, see below. 
                  jalt is possible that Denham actually published the Hippolytus and Hercules Oetaeus, as he did the Octauia, 
                    but if so they have not  survived and, even as early as 8th January 1584 (Arber  11.789) Denham  was 
                    somewhat   vague  about them  for at that time  he ‘yielded for the use of the poor of the Company’ 
                    his rights in ‘Two or three of Seneca his Tragedies’. It may also be noted that of the ten other books 
                    which he yielded at that time there were several whose copyright he had acquired from Seres (but with- 
                    out recording the transfer) and of which he is not known to have himself published any edition. 
                  faSeveral of the original proprietors were, by 1581, dead or out of business. There is no record of their 
                    transfer of the copyright of these books, but, as noted above, Denham,   at least, considered the two 
                    translations which he had entered in 1566-7 as still his property in 1584.

degrees of scholarship possessed by the individual dramatists. Seneca’s Tragedies were 
                             presented in the original Latin to academic audiences both before and after these trans- 
                             lations were made so that if they had any great influence upon  the direction of the 
                             English drama, as distinct from the more sterile role of indicating contemporary inter- 
                             est in the classical drama, it must have been exercised through the earlier separate 
                             editions rather than this collected form.
