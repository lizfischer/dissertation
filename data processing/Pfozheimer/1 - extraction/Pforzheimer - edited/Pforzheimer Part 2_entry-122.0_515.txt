Etched frontispiece portrait of the author by Claude Melan; in fifth statet. 

{This plate was first issued in the third state—in the French edition of Dodona's Grove 1641. The earlier, 
proof states may be distinguished: The first, with face, collar, and hat barely outlined (only known copy 
inserted in Currer-Crawford copy of Londinopolis); and the second, with these filled-in but still no inscrip- 
tions nor signatures (e.g. British Museum, Dept. of Prints). 
The third state has inscriptions and signatures; it was issued with the work cited before and The Pre- 
heminence and Pedigree of Parlement 1644 (not in England's Teares as stated in D.N.B.). In the fourth 
state, as used in The German Diet 1653, the plate is worn out, part of the background with horse and rider 
erased, face and collar re-engraved, the collar much narrower, and the expression of the face different: 
frowning and ferrety (in the earlier states it is careless and jaunty—no trace of a frown). The fifth state, 

  

the present, has been re-worked with arms added.

‘Tene seems to be no explanation for the gap in pagination as the text is continuous 
at that point. However, sheet Aa has a different format in headlines, drop-heads, etc. 
from the rest of the book and presumably represents the work of another compositor. 
‘This is an early forerunner of the present day popular topographical books and like 
them is largely borrowed from standard authorities. 

there are two recuttings, according to Hind, of this plate. One, which is very close, may be distinguished 
by the absence of the slipped stroke on the white spaces of the arms; the other by the measurements, being 
much narrower—254 x 12 inches,
