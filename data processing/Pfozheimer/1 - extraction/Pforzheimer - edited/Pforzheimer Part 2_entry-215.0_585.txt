Blue morocco, gilt medallions on sides, by Riviere. 834 x 634 inches. The Huth (IV, 1914, Lot 
4278)—Jones (1919, Lot 1021) copy with Jones bookplate (Huth removed). The signature of 
‘Thomas Park on fourth title. If this is the Bibliotheca Anglo-Poetica (1815, No.426) copy, after- 
wards sold in the fourth Heber sale (Lot 1355), then either the B.4.P. description is wrong or 
it has since been made-up and the ‘many MS additions by Park’ removed. 

Corres containing all four parts are very uncommon, and of those which can be traced 
the present appears to be the finest. As might be expected, purchasers at the time of 
publication usually desired only one or at most two parts and several copies exist 
which appear to have been originally bound in that fashion. 
The preliminary leaves are the same in each of the four parts although there are four 
states. These states are not peculiar to any one part but occur in all. Thirteen of the 
sixteen possible permutations have been seen. 
In one state, not necessarily the earliest but possibly so, the verso of title is blank 
(no portrait of Charles and no music); the first and third parts of the British Museum 

{The Table does not appear in this part,

copy (C.110) have that state. In another state, there is no portrait but the music occurs 
on verso of title; the present fourth part is an example, as is a copy of the first part 
now at Bernard Quaritch Ltd., and the third part in the B.M. (K3.h.18f). Another 
state, and so far as observed the most common of all, has both the portrait and music 
on verso of title. That state has been found in all four parts. Another state has the 
portrait as a frontispiece and the music on verso of title. This state occurs in the first 
and third parts of the present copy and in the second and fourth parts of the Hunting- 
ton (Locker-Church) copy. 
The version of the psalms here used is that of George Sandys [q.v.]. 
fItis unlikely that this state merely represents imperfect copies for the British Museum copy is in original 

binding.
