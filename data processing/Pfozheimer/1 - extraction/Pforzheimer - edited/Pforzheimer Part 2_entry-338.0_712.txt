Mottled calf, extra, gilt over sprinkled edges, by Riviere. 794 x 534 inches, In brown moroceo 
case by Stikeman. The Huth (V, 1916, Lot 4991) copy with bookplate. 

Turs collectiont of elegiac verses would be no more sought after or venerated than are 
the hundreds of similar academic volumes which, though often of considerable rarity, 
lie unregarded in libraries and bookshops, were it not that the last six pages of text 
contain the first appearance of Miltonâ€™s Lycidas. 
Copies of this book are not uncommon; we have located some thirty and there are 
a number more which we have not traced. But no copy of which we find record or 
which we have seen equals the present in size and condition.
