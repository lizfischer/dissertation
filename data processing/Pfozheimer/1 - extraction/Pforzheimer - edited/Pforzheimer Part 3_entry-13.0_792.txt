                             ‘Tue inner forme of sheet E was corrected in the press. In the present and the Dyce copy 
                             it is in an uncorrected state. In the British Museum copy it is corrected. The earlier 
                             state may be distinguished by the reading of line 2, verso E,‘ . . . ruderamruffe...’ 
                             which in the later reads‘ . . . rim ram ruffe .. .’. 
                               This play was first assigned to Peele by William Herbert and  the attribution has 
                             never been disputed. It appears to have been written between January 1593 and  May 
                             1594, and, as one of the characters is apparently a caricature of Gabriel Harvey, this 
                             play has a place in the Harvey-Nashe  controversy (Mod.Phil.XXX,    1932, pp-23-8)- 
                             The  text here printed is ‘almost certainly’ mutilated (Malone Society Reprint). 
                               Only three other copies are known, all in public collections, viz. the British Museum 
                             (King’s), Dyce (Heber), and Huntington (Bridgewater). There  is no copy in the Bod- 
                             leian; the entry in the S.7.C. being an error.
