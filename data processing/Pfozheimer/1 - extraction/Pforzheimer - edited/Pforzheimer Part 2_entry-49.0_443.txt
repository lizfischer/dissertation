Original black calf, sound. 12 x 8 inches. Two volumes bound in one; regarding possibility of 
original issue in this fashion, and map, see below. Bookplate of Sir William Nigel Gresley; early 
inscription on title: ‘Will: Longworth ex Dono Avunculi Tho: Cox.’. 

Ture are two cancel titlest to the first volume dated 1599; in one, reproduced Church 
Catalogue, the seventh line ends ‘ . . . yeres;’, while in the other it ends ‘. . . yeares:’. 
They are entirely reset and omit the reference to ‘the famous victorie atchieued at the 
citie of Cadiz, 1596’. The reason for this alteration was not that the booksellers desired 
to bring the title up to date but that, after the disgrace of the Earl of Essex in 1599, the 
“Voyage to Cadiz’ (Sig [Eee4]-[Fff4], pp.607-[620]) was ordered suppressed. Copies with 
a 1599 title, therefore, properly should have those leaves cancelled. After the death of 
Elizabeth, however, the Voyage was reprintedtt and that later setting is frequently 
found inserted. The reprint may be easily distinguished from the original (present) as 

{The latter part of the second volume, from Sig Aaa to the end, was printed by Newbery, while Barker 
printed all the rest. . 

They were probably printed simultaneously though so far as we have observed the setting reproduced in 
the Church Catalogue is the more common. 

HThere is a third setting, obviously a nineteenth century reprint, which collates a-d2(the last, a blank), 
p.607 contains 52 lines divided into seven paragraphs.

the number of paragraphs on p.607 differs. In the original setting§ which consists of 
seven leaves, there are 53 lines of text divided into eight paragraphs; in the reprint, 
which is a compressed setting in six leaves, there are 63 lines divided into ten paragraphs. 
It is probable, though the title calls for ‘three feuerall Volumes’ that this fine copy 
was bound and sold to the original purchaser before the third volume, which bears the 
date 1600, was prepared. It is generally allowed that the map which belongs in that 
third volume, though only occasionally found, was not issued with all copies. 

§In the present copy quire Eee appears from the watermarks to be a regular gathering of three sheets. 
However, in most copies with this setting of the Voyage all the leaves in this gathering appear to be 
disjunct and in a copy now in the possession of Bernard Quaritch Ltd. their stubs are all clearly visible. 
There seems no reason to doubt that this is the original setting and, therefore, the simplest explanation 
is that when the Voyage was ordered suppressed Sig [Eee4)-[Fff4] were cut out but not destroyed and in 
some copies which were unsold after Elizabeth’s death the original leaves were re-inserted.
