‘Tus was reissued with Baldwin’s address considerably amended, Sig A1-2 cancels, so 
that, as reprinted, it extends to verso A2. The major alteration consists in the addition 
(recto A2) of references to William Rufus, Robert Duke of Normandy, and the children 
of King Henry, but the phrasing is in several places improved. This edition} contains 
in the first part a paginary (except for minor alterations in the prose introductions) 
reprint of the first edition (q.v.] and in the second part eight new tragedies besides 
Sackville’s Induction. From the editor’s note (beginning verso P) it appears that the 
‘tragedy’ concerning the two princes murdered in the Tower which the Lord Vaux had 
undertaken to write was not ready and that in place was inserted Sackville’s ‘tragedy’ 
of Buckingham with the Induction preceding itt}. This alteration in plan probably 
accounts for the change at that point from double to single sheet gatherings. 
The inclusion here of the tragedy of Somerset which was omitted at the last moment 
from the first edition has been explained by Miss Feasey (Trans. LIL, 1923, 187-8). That 
poem, however, does not from a literary viewpoint make this edition so notable as does 
the appearance for the first time of Sackville’s Induction§ and Churchyard’s Shore's 
Wife. 

{The copy was evidently divided between two compositors; one set up sheets B-K, and the other the re- 
mainder. 

Hin this edition the tragedies of Humphrey and Eleanor are omitted not only from the text but also from 
the Tabl . 
The division into two parts of Sackville’s contribution was not apparently intended by the author, see note 
fon the MS, discovered at St, John’s College Cambridge by Miss Margaret Hearsey, R.E.S. VIII (1932) 
232. 
§The last line of the frst stanza, recto P3, reads in the present: 
blowen.’ while in other copies, e.g, the Church- 
tree downe blowen.”
