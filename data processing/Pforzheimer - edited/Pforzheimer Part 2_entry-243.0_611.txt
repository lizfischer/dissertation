â€˜Tuns collection of letters is unusual for the reason that unlike the customary practice 
it contains both sides of the correspondence. It should also be observed that the manu- 
script letters of Thomas and William Molyneux to Locke, here published, are in this 
collection. The printer used the originals for copy and they still bear his marks.
