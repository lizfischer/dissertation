Green morocco, neat, by Riviere. 1074 x 674 inches. Possibly this copy was the one suld by 
G.D.Smith (Literature from London 1916, Lot 450). 

‘Tue last three plays in this volume had been published at London in 1664-5 [q.v.) 
What arrangement, if any, the Oxford publisher made with Playfere who had regis- 
tered those plays 21 October 1664, is not known. Nor is there any explanation of the 
form of the imprint to Selindra (see above). Presumably, however, this Oxford edition 
was more or less a private adventure of the author’s. 
The presence of signatures on some of the titles is uncommon.
