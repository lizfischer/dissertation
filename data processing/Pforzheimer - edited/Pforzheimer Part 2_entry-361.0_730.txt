AcconvING to the dedication “The wurke was begun, & part of it printed .iiii. yeare 
agoe, but hyndred by the lord Chauncellour that then was, . . .’. The vestiges of 
that thwarted attempt are still to be seen in some copies of Wayland’s edition of 
Lydgate’s translation of Boccaccio’s Fall of Princes |q.v.]. As was pointed out (Trans. 
II], 1923, 177-193) the authorities, even in Elizabeth’s reign, did not cease hindering 
the publication of this work for, although it was ‘licensed and perused’ at the urgency 
of the Lord Stafford, three poems which were to have been included had to be omitted. 
‘Those poems, all written by George Ferrers, were ‘Good duke Humfrey murdered, and 
Elianor Cobham his wife banifhed’ (two individual poems but thus united in the 
Table which lists them as beginning at fol.40), and the tragedy of the Duke of Somerset. 
The latter piece was evidently expected up to the last minute though it is not included 
in the Table, presumably an accident, for the prose passage at the end of Jack Cade 
refers to it; and there is a gap of eleven numbers left at that point in the foliation while 
the signature sequence is broken alsof. 
Of the present edition seven other copies can be traced, viz. the British Museum 
(Grenville; Blandford-Rhodes), Bodleian (Douce; Wood), Huntington (Chew), Lord 
Aldenham, and the Bemis (Chalmers-Britwell-Clawson). 

  

{The misnumbering of sheet d (fol.71-4) which contains the tragedy of Henry VI appears to be the result 
of division of copy for the type in that sheet differs from that used elsewhere in the volume.
