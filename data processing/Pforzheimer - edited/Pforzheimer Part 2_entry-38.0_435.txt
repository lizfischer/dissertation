On the title and repeated on verso BG is a woodcut, apparently intended to illustrate the story 
of the Knight and a “Tincker’, showing a rabbit (conny) picking a lock with a ‘charme’ while hold- 
ing a sealed letter in his right paw; a pair of dice, ‘natural’, on the ground. On verso [Aa] is a 
woodcut apparently illustrating the story of the horse-thief of Tenro. On verso C is a cut of a 

conny with a ‘nipper’s' (Ie. cut-purse) knife and a tplaying-card. This last cut appears at the 
head of the chapter on the activity of the ‘Nip and the Foist’.

Green morocco, extra, padded with blanks, by Lewis. 674 x 454 inches. The Steevens (1800, Lot 
882) — Roxburghe (1812, Lot 6654) —Heber (IV, 1834, Lot 934) —Freeling (1836, Lot 1267) — 
Britwell (1919, Lot 45)— Clawson (I, 1926, Lot 325) copy. When in the Steevens and Roxburghe 
libraries this was bound in a collection of Conny-catching tracts which was broken-up in the 
Heber sale. For further notes on provenance, see Morando 1584. 

TuovGH called on the title ‘the last part’, this work was supplemented in the year of 
the publication of this edition by “The third and last part’. That part was entered in 
the Stationers’ Register 7th February 1592, and probably published before this second 
edition of the ‘second’ part was issued. This seems the more probable since the entry 
for this part was not made until 13th December 1591, though the first edition is dated 
the same year. However, the copyright of each of the three parts belonged to different 
booksellers who would naturally care very little about such a discrepancy. 
Copies of all of Greene’s conny-catching tracts are extraordinarily rare, in fact the 
present volume appears to be the only one not in a public collection. Of the first edition 
of this second part the Corser-Halliwell-Huth copy, in the Huntington Library, is 
unique; while of this second edition the Malone copy in the Bodleian is the only other 
copy known.
