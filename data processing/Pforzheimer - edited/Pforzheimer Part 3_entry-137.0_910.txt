                 Eighteenth  century calf, gilt and blind-tooled, sprinkled edges. 14 x 9 inches. Sound copy. Sold 
                 at a miscellaneous sale, Sotheby’s 7 December 1904, Lot 880. The Hagen  (1918, Lot 1076) copy 
                 with Hagen  and  White  Wallingwells bookplates. Inscribed on title ‘Hen: Eyre: pret 148:8d:’. 

               THERE  are two settings of the title of this edition and of the present there is a variant. 
               In the latter Chiswell’s name and address is omitted from the imprint which reads: 
               ‘LONDON,    | Printed for H.Herringman,  E.Brewster, and R.Bently, at the Anchor in 
               the | New Exchange, the Crane in St. Pauls Church-Yard, and in | Ruffel-Street Covent- 
               Garden. 1685. |’. 
                 The other setting, e.g. next number, has no period after ‘M®’ in first line of title; a 
               colon replaces the period after ‘Folio’; single brackets are substituted for the outline 
              ones;  the device is replaced by a block of type-ornament;  and  the imprint reads: 
               ‘LONDON,    | Printed for H.Herringman,  and are to be fold by Yofeph Knight | and 
               Francis Saunders, at the Anchor in the Lower Walk  | of the New Exchange. 1685. |’. 
               Knight and  Saunders were the agents to whom  Herringman  entrusted the retail side 
              of  his business so that that title probably appears on such copies as belonged  to 
               Herringman  as his share in this enterprise}. 
                 It has usually been statedt that the Knight and Saunders setting is the earlier. The 
              only evidence  which has been  adduced is that the sole advertisement of this edition 
              published in the Term  Catalogue (Arber 7.C. 11.130) has their names. Such reasoning 
              is specious for all that can be ascertained from that entry is that Knight and Saunders 
              advertised in that medium   while the others did not. It is probable that the two set- 
              tings were simultaneously issued and both titles were available on the same day. 
                 The copy  for this edition was divided among several shops. Some  miscalculation 
              apparently occurred  so that the equivalent of about one column of additional matter 
              had  to be crowded into Sig L which is therefore printed in a much smaller type than 

  

               the rest of the volume. 

                  + By 1685 the Stationers’ Register is no longer very useful for tracing transfers of copyright and the respective 
                    shares owned  by the four booksellers whose names occur in the imprint cannot be defined. However, it 
                    should be noted  that Robert Scott at the time owned a considerable moiety, cf. Eyre II, 488; III, 188.

In  the first alphabet both formes of each sheett{ of quires K-Z have  an asterisk 
                              placed inside the box-rule at the bottom of the type-page, one to each forme but not 
                              always on  the same page. It is possible that this is a compositor’s or office signature 
                              but nothing like it has been observed in other books of this period similarly divided 
                              among  several shops.
