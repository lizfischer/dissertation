                  Original calf, four decorated bands on spine with acorn-ornament   between, gilt arms on sides, 
                  yellow edges, traces of green linen ties. 754 x 534 inches. The arms, which are dated 1600, are 
                  those of Peter Manwood    whose  signature, dated ‘16. of May .16c0. pret. 3s.’, is on flyleaf. At 
                  either side of Manwood’s   arms, at a later date, were placed the initials ‘H P’ in blind. Subse- 
                  quently this book was  in the possession of Stuart of Dunnairn (bookplate), Joseph Ritson (sig- 
                  nature, untraced in sales), Heber (VI, 1835, Lot 3659), and Christie-Miller (1924, Lot 772). 

               In the dedication to Sir Thomas  Sackville, Walker says that this work ‘was the first 
               labour of a worthie  Gentleman  of your Lordships Countrey  of Sussex, ... who did 
               it for his exercise in the Spanish tongue, and keeping it by him many yeeres, as iudging 
               it vtterly vnwoorthy of his owne name,  did lately bestowe the same vpon me, with 
               expresse charge howsoeuer  I should dispose thereof, to conceale all mention of him: 
               wherin I should haue doone  both him  and my  selfe too much wrong in obeying him 
               ...’. In the dedication to Lewkenor  he further states: ‘. . . Receaue therefore, gen- 
               tle Maister Lewkenor, this poore Treatise, having so many long yeeres lien obscured 
               among  your  wast papers, and lately by your cruell sentence condemned to the fire, 
               now  with a milder conceit vnder your protection; For though you thinke it vnworthy 
               of the worlds view, as beeing the fruite and exercise of your youngest yeeres, yet I 
               assure you, it hath passed the censure of graue and learned iudgements, and receiued 
               excellent allowance; thorough whose encouragements  I haue presumed  to giue it life 
                 Apparently,  therefore, this is to be added to the list of translations of Lewis Lewke- 
               nor; perhaps revised by Walker for he declares in the same address: ‘. . . whatsoeuer 
               therein is faultie, let the same lie vpon my shoulders .. .’.
