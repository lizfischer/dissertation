‘This is the first English translation of the Fasti. As befits the original, it is a scholarly 
work and a credit to the society which encouraged it. It was posthumously published 
by the translator’s friends. Of Gower himself little is known except that he was admit- 
ted sizar at Jesus College, gth August 1628, and proceeded much as usual taking his 
M.A. in 1636. 
What connection Mistress Griffin may have had with the publishing of this volume 
is not clear but she entered for it, 12th October 1639, and there does not appear to be 
any transfer.
