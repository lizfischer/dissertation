              tThis crest appears, except for the crescent for difference, to be from the same block or casting as the crest 
                of Leicester's brother Ambrose, Earl of Warwick, which was used by Denham   in the same year on the

                                Rev.Henry  White  (listed in Harding, Triphook and Lepard  1824 Catalogue  of White’s books 
                                Pt. II Lot 12587) — Saunders (1827) — Britwell (1923, Lot 599) copy with White’s signature dated 
                                11 June 1806. Undecipherable signature dated 1686, on verso unsigned leaf. 

                             FRom internal evidence the attribution of this tragedy to Seneca has been questioned. 
                             In Elizabethan times, however, not only was  this part of the Senecan  canon but, 
                            equally with the others, represented the current conception of classical drama.
