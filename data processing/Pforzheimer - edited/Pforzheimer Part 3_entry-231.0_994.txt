               Contemporary   calf, rebacked, extra, traces of ties, red sprinkled edges. 734 x 534 inches. Book- 
              plates of F.A.Waite  and  Alan H. Stenning, Sold Hodgson’s,  18 December  1929. 

             In some  copies (e.g. the Grenville and  Bridgewater-Huntington)  the date  of ‘this 
             prefent yeere’ is stated on the title to be 1617, but the discrepancy with the date in the 
             imprint appears to have  been observed before many  copies were printed and the last 
             digit altered. 
               The churchwardens   of St. Botolph’s, Aldgate, gave Anthony Munday  in April 1618 
             ‘a piece of Gold of two and twentie shillings’ for presenting a copy of this book to the 
            parish  (P.M.L.4.  March   1926, N. & Q. 5 February  and 4 June  1927). He was  also 
            rewarded  by  the Court of Aldermen with a present of £60, according to the Guildhall 
             Repertory (cf. Arthur H. Johnson  Drapers III p.3 7). 
               The inserted half-sheet signed ‘#’ contains a description of the opening of the reser- 
            voir of the New  River and is intrinsically of considerable interest as well as rarity. 
               According  to William  Roberts  (Book-Hunter  p.xxvii) copies of this edition are 
            known   on large-paper.
