VOL. [737]

Eighteenth century Pembroke morocco. 934 x 734 inches. In brown solander-case by Riviere. 
Ten leaves lacking, viz. at (blank), b1, £8, it~4, m8, pt, and s6. The Pembroke (1914, Lot 140) — 
Huntington (private) copy. On the flyleaf is a long note ‘by Mr. [Samuel] Palmer’, but not in his 
hand, declaring this to be the first book printed by Caxton. 

Iv 1483, Caxton printed another version of this ‘preacher's assistant’, as Duff described 
this work. He did not reprint that text in the present but instead followed the superior 
version printed at Oxford by Rood and Hunte in 1486. 
Copies of both Caxton’s versions usually have appended copies of the Quattuor 
Sermones which supplement the Festial, though the two Caxton editions of the 9.8. 
are bibliographically distinct. However, there can be little doubt but that most, if not 
all, copies of Caxton’s editions of the Festial were originally issued with them appended. 
There is but one fifteenth century edition, the Rood and Hunte, which does not have a 
companion edition of the 2.8., while two editions, the Hopyl, 149, and the Morin, 
1499, have them linked by common signature sequence. 
Only five other copies of this edition can be traced, all imperfect, viz. the British 
Museum (James), University Library Cambridge (Potter), Bodleian (Crynes), Rylands 
(Roxburghe-Spencer), and Huntington (Devonshire). Of these only the Bodleian copy 
is without the coeval 9.8. 

{Itis, in fact, a collection of sermons drawn from the Legenda Aurea and intended for Sundays and holydays, 
hence called *Festial’.
