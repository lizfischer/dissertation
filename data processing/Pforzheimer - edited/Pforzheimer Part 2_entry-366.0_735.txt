‘Tus volume was called ‘the first parte’ because these tragedies antedate historically 
those which had been edited by William Baldwin. Unlike the Baldwin volume, how- 
ever, they were all written by one author, Higgins. Marshe was the publisher of the 
two parts and, in 1574 and 1575, he printed editions of Soth in uniform format, some 
copies of which he probably sold together as sets. 
‘The Huntington copy has what appears to be a proof of sheet Ar-2 and (7-8]. That 
setting may be distinguished by the reading of the heading on recto fol.1, “The Authors 
induction’. In the present the heading reads “The authors induction’. 
The first edition of this part, 1574, was originally issued ending with the tragedy of 
Nennius. Before all copies of that edition were sold, however, the half-sheet signed K 
was discarded and its contents reprinted (with eleven additional stanzas added to the 
verses “The Authors’) together with the tragedy of Irenglas on a double-sheet signed 
K and a half.sheet L (the last leaf, blank). These sheets were used the following year 
in this second edition.
