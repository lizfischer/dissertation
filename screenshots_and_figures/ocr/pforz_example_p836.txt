Tuts Retractation is a palpable forgery which Prynne attempted to expose immediately 
by means of a broadside (reprinted Collier Poetical Decameron II, 321) headed: ‘The 
vindication of William Prynne, Esquire from some scandalous papers and imputations 
newly printed and published to traduce and defame his reputation’. As late as 2nd 
October 1649, the writer of 4 serious epistle to Mr. William Prynne pretended to think 
the Retractation was genuine (Hotson Commonwealth and Restoration Stage pp.41-2). 
Only two other copies of this piece can be traced in the auction sales and it is doubt- 
ful if a half-dozen exist.
